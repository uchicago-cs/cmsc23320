/* 
 *
 *  CMSC 23320 - Foundations of Computer Networks
 *  
 *  A simple multi-threaded server
 *  
 *  Written by: Borja Sotomayor
 *
 *  To compile:
 *
 *      gcc server-pthreads.c -o server-pthreads -lpthread
 *
 *  To run:
 *
 *      ./server-pthreads
 *
 *  The server will listen on port 23320. You can connect to
 *  it from a telnet session like this:
 *
 *      telnet localhost 23320
 *
 *  Do this multiple time to observe how the server can support
 *  multiple connections at the same time.

           and spawn more threads to handle them.

           New threads are created using the pthread_create function.
           - The first parameter is a pointer to a pthread_t variable, which we can use
             in the remainder of the program to manage this thread.
           - The second parameter is used to specify the attributes of this new thread
             (e.g., its stack size). We can leave it NULL here.
           - The third parameter is the function this thread will run. This function *must*
             have the following prototype:

               void *f(void *args);

             Note how the function expects a single parameter of type void*. In this case,
             the thread function will be service_single_client.
           - The fourth parameter to pthread_create is used to specify the parameter
             to the thread function. In this case, the worker thread needs to know what socket
             it must use to communicate with the client, so we'll pass the client_socket as a
             parameter to the thread. Although we could arguably just pass a pointer to client_socket,
             it is good practice to use a struct that encapsulates the parameters to the thread
             (even if there is only one parameter). In this case, this is done with the worker_args struct.

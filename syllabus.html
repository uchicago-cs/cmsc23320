<p class="admonition-title">What happened to CMSC 23300 Networks and Distributed Systems?</p>
<p>This class was offered for many years under a different code and name, <em>CMSC 23300 Networks and Distributed Systems</em>, despite
the fact that it only covered Networks topics (with Distributed Systems topics covered in <em>CMSC 23310 Advanced Distributed
Systems</em>). So, in 2020, we renamed CMSC 23300 to better reflect its contents and scope. However, other than the change in
code and name, CMSC 23320 covers the same topics and uses the same projects as CMSC 23300.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-description">
<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course focuses on the principles and techniques used in the
development of networked and distributed software. Topics include
programming with sockets; concurrent programming; data link layer
(Ethernet, packet switching, 802.11, etc.); internet and routing
protocols (IP, IPv6, ARP, intra-domain and inter-domain routing, etc.);
end-to-end protocols (UDP, TCP); and other commonly used network
protocols and techniques.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>…implement multithreaded client/server applications using sockets.</p></li>
<li><p>…interpret existing specifications of network protocols, and
translate them into code.</p></li>
<li><p>…design and combine network protocols that form the foundation of the
Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>…develop software collaboratively through the use of version control
tools, code reviews, and project management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, students will learn how the Internet works. By the end of
this course, students should understand <em>everything</em> that happens “under the hood”
when (for example) a web page is requested, from the moment
you click on a link in your browser to the moment you get the requested
page back.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: This class assumes fluency in C programming, including low-level aspects of C such as bit-level
operations. The specific course prerequisites are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Undergraduate students: CMSC 15400 Introduction to Computer Systems</p></li>
<li><p>MPCS students: MPCS 51040 C Programming or 51100 Advanced Programming.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-organization">
<h2>Course organization<a class="headerlink" href="#course-organization" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The development of three programming projects accounts for the majority
of the grade in this course. To successfully complete these projects,
students must master fundamental concepts and skills in networking. The
class meets two times a week for lectures that provide a conceptual
scaffolding for the projects, but will also cover material that is not
directly applied in the projects. Some lectures will also be dedicated to
in-depth discussion of the projects.</p>
<p>Besides the projects, students will also be evaluated with
two homeworks and a final exam. The course calendar, including the contents of
each lecture and project deadlines, is shown in the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> page.</p>
<div class="section" id="projects">
<h3>Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Throughout the quarter, students will develop three projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>chirc</strong>: Implementing an Internet Relay Protocol (IRC)
server (partially compliant with RFC 2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813)
using POSIX sockets and pthreads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chiTCP</strong>: Implementing the Transmission Control Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chirouter</strong>: Implementing an Internet router using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mininet/mininet">Mininet network emulator</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each project is independent from the others. Students will develop these
projects in pairs; project groups must be formed by Monday of the
second week of the quarter.</p>
<p>Groups can be changed from one project to another. If your partner drops out of
the course or you feel they are not contributing to the group’s effort,
you should make the instructor aware of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lectures">
<h3>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#lectures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The course meets twice a week for lectures. In most weeks, one
of the lectures will introduce material that will be expanded upon in
pre-recorded lectures that are made available that week, and the other
lecture will focus on the course projects.</p>
<p>In the project-focused lectures, we will (1)
provide suggestions on how to approach the projects, (2) provide general
feedback on submitted projects, and (3) provide a general forum to
answer questions about the projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homeworks">
<h3>Homeworks<a class="headerlink" href="#homeworks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many of the lectures (both live and pre-recorded) will cover material that is
not directly applied in the projects. Your mastery of this material will be
tested via two homework assignments where you will have to answer questions that involve
reasoning about the material covered in the lectures (e.g., exercises where
you must apply the concepts covered in the lectures, as opposed to questions
that ask you to repeat facts).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exam">
<h3>Exam<a class="headerlink" href="#exam" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>During Finals Week, we will hold a closed-book exam that will test students’
knowledge of the material covered in the lectures, as well as the course projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="books">
<h2>Books<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course has two <em>suggested</em> texts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Computer Networks: A Systems Approach</em>, 6th edition, Larry L.
Peterson and Bruce S. Davie, Morgan Kaufmann 2021.</p></li>
<li><p><em>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols</em>, 2nd Edition, Kevin
Fall and W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley 2011.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These texts are <em>not</em> required, and most students are able to complete the
class successfully without them. However, they can be a good complement
to the lectures and projects.</p>
<p>Please note that <em>Computer Networks: A Systems Approach</em> is freely available
here: <a class="reference external" href="https://book.systemsapproach.org/">https://book.systemsapproach.org/</a></p>

<div class="section" id="asking-questions">
<h2>Asking questions<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preferred form of support for this course is through <a class="reference external" href="https://edstem.org/">Ed Discussion</a>
, an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be added to an Ed Discussion site at the start of the quarter,
and you will be able to access it through Canvas.</p>
<p>All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Ed Discussion, and not directly to the instructors or TAs, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor or the TAs, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Ed Discussion.</p>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/getting-help/questions.html">Asking Questions</a>
page in the <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/">UChicago CS Student Resource Guide</a>
for guidelines and policies related to asking questions on Ed Discussion.</p>
<p>Please note that all course announcements will be made through Ed Discussion. It
is your responsibility to check Ed Discussion often to see if there are any
announcements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commit-messages">
<h2>Commit Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-messages" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Commit messages in your repository should be descriptive and to the point. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Implemented</span> <span class="pre">JOIN</span> <span class="pre">command</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Fixed</span> <span class="pre">bug</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">handling</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">FIN</span> <span class="pre">when</span> <span class="pre">send</span> <span class="pre">buffer</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">empty</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Final</span> <span class="pre">style</span> <span class="pre">updates</span> <span class="pre">before</span> <span class="pre">submission</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that, in an actual project in industry, your commit messages will be seen by everyone
involved in the project, and are an important part of your documentation (as the describe exactly
how your code changed in each commit).</p>
<p>That said, a long-standing tradition in this class has been to collect the best and funniest
commit messages we see throughout the quarter, so we can share those (anonymized) messages with the rest of the class, to
the point that many students will write intentionally funny messages to make it into that “best of”
presentation (past presentations can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://www.slideshare.net/bsotomay">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you do not want your commit messages included in this presentation, please let the instructor know
(or, even better, simply take care to write commit messages that are descriptive and to the point, as
shown above).</p>

<div class="section" id="diversity-statement">
<h3>Diversity statement<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-statement" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple
perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality
interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus
expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect,
and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status.
Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be
appreciated and given serious consideration.</p>
<p>If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, or preferred gender pronouns
you would like us to use, please let us know.</p>

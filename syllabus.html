<section id="course-description">
<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course focuses on the principles and techniques used in the
development of networked and distributed software. Topics include
programming with sockets; concurrent programming; data link layer
(Ethernet, packet switching, 802.11, etc.); internet and routing
protocols (IP, IPv6, ARP, intra-domain and inter-domain routing, etc.);
end-to-end protocols (UDP, TCP); and other commonly used network
protocols and techniques.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>…implement multithreaded client/server applications using sockets.</p></li>
<li><p>…interpret existing specifications of network protocols, and
translate them into code.</p></li>
<li><p>…design and combine network protocols that form the foundation of the
Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>…develop complex software starting from an existing codebase, working
collaboratively with other developers, and using industry-standard tools,
including generative AI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, students will learn how the Internet works. By the end of
this course, students should understand <em>everything</em> that happens “under the hood”
when (for example) a web page is requested, from the moment
you click on a link in your browser to the moment you get the requested
page back.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: This class assumes fluency in C programming, including low-level aspects of C such as bit-level
operations. Students must complete either CMSC 15400 Introduction to Computer Systems or CMSC 14400 Systems Programming II
before taking this class.</p>
</section>
<section id="communication">
<h2>Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of different ways we’ll be communicating about the class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Course materials</strong> - Assignments and other course materials will be made available through this website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion and announcements</strong> - We will use Ed Discussion for course discussion and announcements. If you are
registered for the class, you will be added to our Canvas site, and will be able to access our Ed Discussion
site through Canvas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Course work and feedback</strong> - We will use Gradescope to collect your homework and projects and to return feedback.
You can access our Gradescope site through Canvas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Office hours</strong> - Office hours are times when the course staff are available for you. Instructors and teaching
assistants will have scheduled office hours in-person and/or online. While most students use this as an opportunity
to ask about course work, you’re free to ask about or discuss things that are related directly or indirectly with
the course or with computer science more generally.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="getting-help.html">Getting Help</a> page for more information on getting help using Ed Discussion and through office hours</p>
</section>
<section id="course-organization">
<h2>Course organization<a class="headerlink" href="#course-organization" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The development of three programming projects accounts for the majority
of the work in this course. To successfully complete these projects,
students must master fundamental concepts and skills in networking. The
class meets two times a week for lectures that provide a conceptual
scaffolding for the projects, but will also cover material that is not
directly applied in the projects. Some lectures will also be dedicated to
in-depth discussion of the projects.</p>
<p>Besides the projects, students must demonstrate mastery of the material covered
in lectures and in the projects via a series of short <em>checkpoint exams</em> that take place
throughout the quarter. If a student does not pass a checkpoint exam, they will
have a chance to make up for it at the final exam.</p>
<p>The course calendar, including the contents of
each lecture and project deadlines, is shown in the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> page.</p>
<section id="projects">
<h3>Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Throughout the quarter, students will develop three projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>chirc</strong>: Implementing an Internet Relay Protocol (IRC)
server (partially compliant with RFC 2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813)
using POSIX sockets and pthreads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chiTCP</strong>: Implementing the Transmission Control Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chirouter</strong>: Implementing an Internet router using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mininet/mininet">Mininet network emulator</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each project is independent from the others. Students will develop these
projects in pairs; project groups must be formed by Monday of the
second week of the quarter.</p>
<p>Groups can be changed from one project to another. If your partner drops out of
the course or you feel they are not contributing to the group’s effort,
you should make the instructor aware of this.</p>
</section>
<section id="checkpoint-exams-and-final-exam">
<h3>Checkpoint Exams (and Final Exam)<a class="headerlink" href="#checkpoint-exams-and-final-exam" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There will be ten checkpoint exams throughout the quarter, each with a duration between
10 and 20 minutes. Each exam will be graded on a S/N/U scale:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory (S)</strong>: You have demonstrated mastery of the topic covered in
that exam, and will be exempted from that topic in the final exam.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement (N)</strong> and <strong>Unsatisfactory (U)</strong>: You have not demonstrated
sufficient mastery in the topic, but you will have
another chance to demonstrate your mastery of that topic at the final exam.
A “Needs Improvement” indicates that you did demostrate some mastery of the
topic and, as explained below, it may contribute towards earning certain
grades in the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the final exam serves <strong>only</strong> to provide a second chance to
improve your score on the checkpoint exams. This means that, if you earn an S on
all the checkpoint exams, you can skip the final exam. It also means you
could skip all the checkpoint exams, and only take the final exam.</p>
<p>To get the most out of the checkpoint exams, you should treat them like <strong>practice exams</strong>.
While some mild preparation is fine, you should not study heavily for them, and should
use them as a way to <strong>checkpoint</strong> your knowledge of the material (and as an opportunity
to get feedback on your level of mastery). If you happen to already master the material,
there is a reward involved (you won’t be “re-tested” on that material at the final),
but always remember that, if you earn an N or U on a checkpoint exam, you will have another chance
to improve your score at the final exam.</p>
</section>
<section id="lectures">
<h3>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#lectures" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The course meets twice a week for lectures. In most weeks, one
of the lectures will introduce material that will be expanded upon in
pre-recorded lectures that are made available that week, and the other
lecture will focus on the course projects.</p>
<p>In the project-focused lectures, we will (1)
provide suggestions on how to approach the projects, (2) provide general
feedback on submitted projects, and (3) provide a general forum to
answer questions about the projects.</p>
</section>
<section id="discussion-sessions">
<h3>Discussion Sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-sessions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The discussion sessions on Week 1 and 2 will be used to cover
socket programming and thread programming, which will be required
for Project 1.</p>
<p>The rest of the discussion sessions will be used to hold checkpoint exams, immediately
followed by a discussion of the solutions to that checkpoint exam.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="books">
<h2>Books<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course has two <em>suggested</em> texts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Computer Networks: A Systems Approach</em>, 6th edition, Larry L.
Peterson and Bruce S. Davie, Morgan Kaufmann 2021. Please note
this book is freely available at: <a class="reference external" href="https://book.systemsapproach.org/">https://book.systemsapproach.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols</em>, 2nd Edition, Kevin
Fall and W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley 2011.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These texts are <em>not</em> required, and most students are able to complete the
class successfully without them. However, they can be a good complement
to the lectures and projects. To that end, here are the chapters from
each book that relate to the topics covered in class:</p>

<section id="snu-scale">
<h3>SNU Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#snu-scale" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>All work in this course will be evaluated using a S/N/U scale:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong> (S): The student demonstrates sufficient mastery of the material.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong> (N): The student has put in a good-faith effort to complete the work, but revealed a lack of mastery in the material that can be addressed via concrete feedback. The work could become Satisfactory with revisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unsatisfactory</strong> (U): The student did not submit any work, or did not complete a sufficient portion of the work (e.g., completed less than half the work that was assigned).</p></li>

<p>Project resubmissions in this class will follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Resubmissions for Project 1 will open after Project 1B is graded. i.e., there won’t be two
separate resubmissions for Projects 1A and 1B. You will have roughly one week to make your
resubmission after Project 1B is returned to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Same as above, but for Project 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Project 3 is due on the last week of classes, which means there will not be enough time
for us to grade it <em>and</em> allow resubmissions before grades are due. You will, however, be
allowed to make resubmissions to improve your score on the Completeness score (i.e., the automated tests).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Individual projects will include specific instructions and a concrete timeline for resubmissions
in that project.</p>
<p>Checkpoint Exams are effectively “resubmitted” at the Final Exam.
For avoidance of doubt, the Final Exam will not involve the exact same questions as the Checkpoint Exams
(but will generally test the same concepts/skills).</p>

<section id="commit-messages">
<h2>Commit Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-messages" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Commit messages in your repository should be descriptive and to the point. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Implemented</span> <span class="pre">JOIN</span> <span class="pre">command</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Fixed</span> <span class="pre">bug</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">handling</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">FIN</span> <span class="pre">when</span> <span class="pre">send</span> <span class="pre">buffer</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">empty</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Final</span> <span class="pre">style</span> <span class="pre">updates</span> <span class="pre">before</span> <span class="pre">submission</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that, in an actual project in industry, your commit messages will be seen by everyone
involved in the project, and are an important part of your documentation (as the describe exactly
how your code changed in each commit).</p>
<p>That said, a long-standing tradition in this class has been to collect the best and funniest
commit messages we see throughout the quarter, so we can share those (anonymized) messages with the rest of the class, to
the point that many students will write intentionally funny messages to make it into that “best of”
presentation (past presentations can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://www.slideshare.net/bsotomay">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you do not want your commit messages included in this presentation, please let the instructor know
(or, even better, simply take care to write commit messages that are descriptive and to the point, as
shown above).</p>

<section id="policies">
<h2>Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#policies" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="project-late-policy">
<h3>Project Late Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#project-late-policy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Late submissions will not be accepted in this class, except under extraordinary circumstances. Please bear in mind that the grading scheme is set up to absorb a reasonable amount of subpar work, and also allows you to resubmit almost all the work in this class.</p>
<p>To get the most out of this class, you should not treat the initial deadline for
a project as the date by which you must submit a perfectly polished version of your work (although
you should still aim to do so!) In other words, it is ok to submit a less-than-ideal piece of work by the
deadline, as you will have an opportunity to revise it later on.</p>
<p>That said, to be clear: <strong>if you encounter some sort of emergency (medical, family, etc.) please reach out to us as soon as you are able to do so</strong>. We are more than happy to find ways to provide additional flexibility in these situations. Ideally, you should notify us of these circumstances before the work is due so we can discuss options with you.</p>
<p>In other words, our late submission policy applies to <em>ordinary</em> circumstances: if you are having a busy week, if your RSO has an event that overlaps with a deadline, etc., then you should rely on the resubmission policy to give you some extra flexibility. Instead of trying to argue for a few extra days to work on an assignment, you should just submit the work you have completed by the deadline, so you can get feedback on that work and use that feedback to improve your work.</p>
</section>
<section id="missing-checkpoint-exams">
<h3>Missing Checkpoint Exams<a class="headerlink" href="#missing-checkpoint-exams" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>While we understand that some students may have legitimate reasons to miss a checkpoint exam
(illness, travel to academic events, etc.), it is unfortunately not logistically feasible
for us to schedule make-up exams for every checkpoint exam.</p>
<p>As such, except for approved SDS accommodations, <strong>you can only take a checkpoint exam at its
scheduled time</strong>. If you are unable to take the exam at that time, the mechanism to make up
for that missing exam is to complete the corresponding portion of the final exam. Additionally,
we will share the exam questions (and solutions) with the class after each exam is graded,
so you will still be able to use those to prepare for the final exam.</p>
<p>Please remember that these checkpoint exams are effectively optional: if you do not pass
a checkpoint exam (or are unable to take it), you get a “do-over” at the final exam.</p>
<p>To be clear, we will be more flexible at the final exam if someone has a legitimate reason
for not being able to take the final exam at the time scheduled by the Registrar.</p>
</section>
<section id="grade-disputes">
<h3>Grade Disputes<a class="headerlink" href="#grade-disputes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Except in very specific cases (described below), you cannot dispute
the score assigned to you on a piece of work. The score you receive on
a piece of work is meant to convey feedback on your level of mastery,
and you should take it as an opportunity to understand the areas of
improvement in your work. You are more than welcome to ask us for
concrete advice on how to improve your work; we are always more
than happy to have those kind of conversations with students,
including going over your code. On the other hand, we will not
entertain requests to change your score just because you feel your
work deserved a higher score.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this: if a grader made a factual mistake in
your grading. Please note that this only includes cases where a grader
makes an erroneous statement about your code in their feedback. It
does not include cases where you simply disagree with whether
something deserves to be flagged as incorrect.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you receive a piece of feedback that says
“Incorrect: Function X did not check that parameter Y is greater than
zero”. If function X in your code did perform this check, and the
grader missed this fact (and erroneously gave you that feedback), you
can ask us to review this decision. Please note that, even if the
feedback is amended, it may not affect your actual SNU score.</p>
<p>We ask that you keep these requests brief and to the point: no more
than a few sentences identifying the exact statement that the grader
made and the reasons you believe the statement was mistaken, including
references to specific parts of your code (e.g., “I did check the
value of the parameter in line 107”). Focus on laying out the facts,
and nothing else.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also your responsibility to make these requests in a
timely manner. Requests to review grading mistakes must be submitted
no later than one week after a graded piece of work is returned to
you. After that time, we will not consider any such requests,
regardless of whether the request is reasonable and justified.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity">
<h3>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This class has a permissive policy on student collaboration and on
the use of Generative AI, but there are still a number of things
that will not be allowed in the class, and which could lead
to an academic integrity case against you.</p>
<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity</a> page specifies
these policies in detail, including specific examples of allowed forms
of collaboration and allowed uses of Generative AI, as well as explanations
on why we also need to place some limits on them.
It is your responsibility familiarize yourself with these policies;
if you are ever unsure of whether you are doing something that
may run afoul of these policies, please don’t hesitate to ask
us for clarification.</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct for Course Staff<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct-for-course-staff" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This class has a <a class="reference external" href="code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct for Course Staff</a>.
We share this code of conduct with you (the students) so you know the
expectations we have set for our staff and, while we expect and hope they
will scrupulously follow this code of conduct, you should let us know if
you witness or experience a code of conduct violation. This will allow us
to continue to improve the student experience in this class, and to prevent
any issues from reoccurring.</p>

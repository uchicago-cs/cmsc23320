<div class="section" id="course-description">
<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course focuses on the principles and techniques used in the
development of networked and distributed software. Topics include
programming with sockets; concurrent programming; data link layer
(Ethernet, packet switching, 802.11, etc.); internet and routing
protocols (IP, IPv6, ARP, intra-domain and inter-domain routing, etc.);
end-to-end protocols (UDP, TCP); and other commonly used network
protocols and techniques.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>…implement multithreaded client/server applications using sockets.</p></li>
<li><p>…interpret existing specifications of network protocols, and
translate them into code.</p></li>
<li><p>…design and combine network protocols that form the foundation of the
Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>…develop software collaboratively through the use of version control
tools, code reviews, and project management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, students will learn how the Internet works. By the end of
this course, students should understand <em>everything</em> that happens “under the hood”
when (for example) a web page is requested, from the moment
you click on a link in your browser to the moment you get the requested
page back.</p>
<p>CMSC 15400 and a working knowledge of the C programming language are
strict prerequisites of this course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-organization">
<h2>Course organization<a class="headerlink" href="#course-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The development of three programming projects accounts for the majority
of the grade in this course. To successfully complete these projects,
students must master fundamental concepts and skills in networking. The
class meets two times a week for lectures that provide a conceptual
scaffolding for the projects, but will also cover material that is not
directly applied in the projects. Some lectures will also be dedicated to
in-depth discussion of the projects. Besides the projects, students will also be evaluated with
two midterms and a final exam. The course calendar, including the contents of
each lecture and project deadlines, is shown in the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> page.</p>
<div class="section" id="projects">
<h3>Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Throughout the quarter, students will develop three projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>chirc</strong>: Implementing an Internet Relay Protocol (IRC)
server (partially compliant with RFC 2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813)
using POSIX sockets and pthreads.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chiTCP</strong>: Implementing the Transmission Control Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chirouter</strong>: Implementing an Internet router using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mininet/mininet">Mininet network emulator</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each project is independent from the others. Students will develop these
projects in pairs; project groups must be formed by Monday of the
second week of the quarter.</p>
<p>Groups can be changed from one project to another. If your partner drops out of
the course or you feel they are not contributing to the group’s effort,
you should make the instructor aware of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lectures">
<h3>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#lectures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The course meets twice a week for lectures over Zoom. In most weeks, one
of the lectures will introduce material that will be expanded upon in
pre-recorded lectures that are made available that week, and the other
lecture will focus on the course projects.</p>
<p>In the project-focused lectures, we will (1)
provide suggestions on how to approach the projects, (2) provide general
feedback on submitted projects, and (3) provide a general forum to
answer questions about the projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lecture-quizzes">
<h3>Lecture Quizzes<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture-quizzes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The pre-recorded lectures will include very simple quizzes that should be trivial to
pass if you pay attention to the videos. The goal of these
quizzes is to reward students who watch the pre-recorded lectures in a timely manner,
and who pay attention while watching the videos.</p>
<p>To earn the points for a quiz, you must
complete the quiz no later than one week after the lecture is posted. Furthermore, if
your total score on the quizzes (for the entire quarter) is above 75%, you will
get 100% of the points allocated to the lecture quizzes on your final grade.
If your total score on the quizzes is below below 75%, you will be awarded a
proportional amount of the points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exams">
<h3>Exams<a class="headerlink" href="#exams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On weeks 4 and 8, as well as during finals week, you will complete online exams through Gradescope.
While each exam will have a time limit ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours, you will be able
to start the exam at any point during a 24-hour period. Please
see the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> page for the exact dates (on an exam date,
the exam will be available from 12:01am to 11:59pm CST of the listed day)</p>
<p>Questions and exercises related to the projects will make up a
substantial part of these exams. Students who have worked on the projects
(which requires understanding the material presented in class) should be
able to answer these questions with relative ease. However, the exams
will also include questions that are not related to the projects, but
will be in line with the learning goals outlined at the beginning of
this syllabus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="books">
<h2>Books<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course has two <em>suggested</em> texts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Computer Networks: A Systems Approach</em>, 5th edition, Larry L.
Peterson and Bruce S. Davie, Morgan Kaufmann 2012.</p></li>
<li><p><em>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols</em>, 2nd Edition, Kevin
Fall and W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley 2011.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These texts are <em>not</em> required, and most students are able to complete the
class successfully without them. However, they can be a good complement
to the lectures and projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading">
<h2>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final grade will be based on the following:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 87%" />
<col style="width: 13%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Project 1a</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Lecture quizzes</p></td>
<td><p>5%</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional
sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>95-100: A</p></li>
<li><p>90-95: A-</p></li>
<li><p>85-90: B+</p></li>
<li><p>80-85: B</p></li>
<li><p>75-80: B-</p></li>
<li><p>70-75: C+</p></li>
<li><p>&lt; 70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We curve only to the extent we might lower the boundaries for one or more letter
grades, depending on the distribution of the raw scores. We will not raise the
boundaries in response to the distribution.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you have a total score of 82 in the course, you are guaranteed
to get, at least, a B (but may potentially get a higher grade if the boundary for
a B+ is lowered).</p>
<p>If you want to take the course pass/fail, a “pass” requires a 60 in the
course and an average of 50 points across the midterms and final exam (this
is a weighted average using the weights specified above).
Students who accrue more than 60 points, but have an average on the
exams that is less than 50, will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Instructions on how to request to take the class pass/fail will be sent closer to
the end of the quarter. Please do not send these requests until we
have posted instructions on how to do so.</p>
<p>Requests to withdraw must be sent to your College advisor, not to the instructor.</p>
<div class="section" id="late-submissions">
<h3>Late submissions<a class="headerlink" href="#late-submissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You are allowed to make <strong>at most two</strong> late submissions on the projects, except Project 1a
(no late submissions are allowed on Project 1a). Late submissions will be accepted up to 72
hours after the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>No credit will be given</strong> for late submissions after you have used up your two allowed
late submissions.</p>
<p><strong>No credit will be given</strong> for <em>any</em> submission made 72 hours after the deadline.</p>
<p>Please note that, while Gradescope does enforce the 72-hour limit on late submissions and will clearly flag
late submissions with a red “LATE” label, it does not enforce our specific limit
of two late submissions. <strong>It is your responsibility to keep track of how many late submissions
you have made so far, and to ensure you don’t make more than two late submissions.</strong></p>
<p>If extraordinary circumstances (illness,
family emergency, etc.) prevent a student from meeting a deadline, we may
grant additional extensions on a case-by-case basis. Whenever possible, the
student must inform their instructor of these extraordinary circumstances
<em>before</em> the deadline.</p>
<p>Please note that having a heavy workload in a given
week does not qualify as an extraordinary circumstance. The purpose of the
two extensions is precisely to give you some flexibility in weeks when you
are busier than usual.</p>
<p>Finally, please note that you are allowed two late submissions per student.
If you work in the same pair throughout the quarter, this effectively translates
to having two late submissions for your pair. However, if you consume your
two late submissions with one project partner, and then
change to a different project partner (who still has late submissions remaining),
you will <em>not</em> be able to submit late as a pair. You each must have late submissions
remaining to be able to submit late as a pair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="regrades">
<h3>Regrades<a class="headerlink" href="#regrades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We sometimes make mistakes, and are happy to review any incorrect grading decision.</p>
<p>However, please note that we will only consider regrade requests where a grader made an
actual mistake (e.g., they took points off claiming you didn’t do something,
when you actually did do it and the grader maybe missed that when reading over
your submission). We will not consider regrade requests that ask for point
penalties to be reduced, or try to argue that we should not be taking points off
for a given issue in your code.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you receive a penalty that says
“-2 points: Function X did not check that parameter Y is greater than zero”.
If function X in your code <em>did</em> perform this check, and the grader
missed this fact (and erroneously applied that penalty), you can submit
a regrade request asking us to review this decision. We ask that you keep
these requests brief and to the point: no more than 1-2 paragraphs identifying
the exact penalty and the reasons you believe it was applied erroneously, including
references to specific parts of your code (e.g., “I did check the value of the
parameter in line 107”). Focus on laying out the facts, and nothing else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let’s say you received the “Function X did not check that
parameter Y is greater than zero” penalty, and function X in your code did <em>not</em> perform this check. In this case, you cannot submit
a regrade request arguing that this is not something for which we should deduct
points, or that the point deduction should be lower. Please note that all penalties
are explicitly approved by an instructor (graders have no discretion to come up with
penalties on their own and, if they took points off for something, it is because they
were directed to do so by an instructor).</p>
<p>Please note that, while you may request a regrade for a specific issue,
an instructor may do a full regrade of your submission if they feel there
are other issues with the grading of your submission. This can result in you
ending up with a lower score on the assignment.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also your responsibility to make
these requests in a timely manner. Requests for regrades must be submitted
no later than <strong>one week</strong> after a graded piece of work is returned to you.
After that time, we will not consider any requests for regrades,
<em>regardless of whether the regrade request is reasonable and justified</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="asking-questions">
<h2>Asking questions<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preferred form of support for this course is through <a class="reference external" href="https://edstem.org/">Ed Discussion</a>
, an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be added to an Ed Discussion site at the start of the quarter,
and you will be able to access it through Canvas.</p>
<p>All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Ed Discussion, and not directly to the instructors or TAs, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor or the TAs, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Ed Discussion.</p>
<p>Please see our <a class="reference external" href="questions.html">Asking Questions</a> page for specific
guidelines and policies related to asking questions on Ed Discussion.</p>
<p>Please note that all course announcements will be made through Ed Discussion. It
is your responsibility to check Ed Discussion often to see if there are any
announcements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commit-messages">
<h2>Commit Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Commit messages in your repository should be descriptive and to the point. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Implemented</span> <span class="pre">JOIN</span> <span class="pre">command</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Fixed</span> <span class="pre">bug</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">handling</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">FIN</span> <span class="pre">when</span> <span class="pre">send</span> <span class="pre">buffer</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">empty</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Final</span> <span class="pre">style</span> <span class="pre">updates</span> <span class="pre">before</span> <span class="pre">submission</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that, in an actual project in industry, your commit messages will be seen by everyone
involved in the project, and are an important part of your documentation (as the describe exactly
how your code changed in each commit).</p>
<p>That said, a long-standing tradition in this class has been to collect the best and funniest
commit messages we see throughout the quarter, so we can share those (anonymized) messages with the rest of the class, to
the point that many students will write intentionally funny messages to make it into that “best of”
presentation (past presentations can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://www.slideshare.net/bsotomay">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you do not want your commit messages included in this presentation, please let the instructor know
(or, even better, simply take care to write commit messages that are descriptive and to the point, as
shown above).</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="zoom-guidelines">
<h3>Zoom guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#zoom-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will be using Zoom in this class. We expect your interactions via Zoom to be consistent with an in-person class experience. Respect the people you’re working with. Enter the Zoom meetings muted if possible (unfortunately, it will not be possible if you’re calling in), and unmute to speak. Raise your hand if you’d like to speak. [There’s a “Raise Hand” button on the participant page.] If your background is unusually noisy, use the chat channel instead of unmuting. We strongly encourage you to have your camera on during our Zoom sessions, but we’ll understand if some of you prefer to keep your video off.</p>
<p>Note that you can set your name in your Zoom profile, so you don’t have to go with whatever was assigned. We encourage you to include your pronouns in your name (if so, please include them after your last name).</p>
<p>Our Zoom class meetings will be recorded and saved to the cloud to allow students in this class to review the discussion, and especially to allow students who can’t participate the opportunity to benefit from class. We will not make these recordings available to anyone but class participants, we will not make them available after the quarter, and students will not be allowed to save copies. However, we have no way to guarantee that students will follow this policy. If you have FERPA concerns, please mask yourself accordingly, e.g., by turning off video and using an alias.</p>

<div class="section" id="diversity-statement">
<h3>Diversity statement<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple
perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality
interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus
expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect,
and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status.

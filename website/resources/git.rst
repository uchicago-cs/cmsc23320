Using Git
---------

In this class, you will be using Git to store and manage your project code. Most of you will have already used Git in previous courses, while some of you may have used only SVN. If you are new to Git, or simply need a refresher, we suggest you work through the `Git homework <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/hw/hw1.html>`__ from CMSC 22000, with the following differences:

* **This is not one of the homeworks for CMSC 23320**. You will not be graded on this, nor can you do this Git homework for extra credit. We are simply pointing you to an existing homework from a different class that explains how to get started with Git step-by-step.
* We will provide you with a GitHub Classroom invite URL on Ed Discussion. Your repository will appear as ``uchicago-cmsc23320-2022/p0-GITHUB_USERNAME`` on your GitHub account.
* For more details on how the invite URL works, we suggest you read through our `Project Registration and Submission <../projects/registering_submitting.html>`__ page, which explains how you will be signing up for the course projects using GitHub Classroom (please note that, unlike the projects, you won't be signing up in teams, and will instead get an individual repository)
* The homework explains how to use HTTPS to clone and access your repository on GitHub; at the time the homework was written, GitHub still allowed you to use your GitHub username and password from the command-line, but that functionality has now been removed from GitHub. To work through the exercises in the homework, you will need to create a `personal access token <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>`__ instead. That said, we recommend you instead set up `SSH access <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`__ for your GitHub account.
* The homework includes a number of tasks that will require figuring out some Git commands on your own. Don't skip these; they can be a really valuable exercise! You don't, however, have to submit anything at the end of the homework (so, ignore all references to Gradescope).

Once you have mastered branches and merging, you may want to read `A successful Git branching model <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__.

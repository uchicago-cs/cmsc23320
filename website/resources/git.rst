Using Git
---------

In this class, you will be using Git to store and manage your project code. Most of you will have already used Git in previous courses, while some of you may have used only SVN. If you are new to Git, or simply need a refresher, we suggest you work through the `Git lab <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/lab1/>`__ from CMSC 22000, with the following differences:

* We will provide you with a GitHub Classroom invite URL on Ed Discussion. Your lab repository will appear as ``uchicago-cmsc23320-2021/p0-GITHUB_USERNAME`` on your GitHub account.
* For more details on how the invite URL works, we suggest you read through our `Project Registration and Submission <../projects/registering_submitting.html>`__ page, which explains how you will be signing up for the course projects using GitHub Classroom (please note that, for the optional Git Lab, you won't be signing up in teams, and will instead get an individual repository)
* The lab includes a number of tasks that will require figuring out some Git commands on your own. Don't skip these; they can be a really valuable exercise! You don't, however, have to submit anything at the end of the lab (so, ignore all references to Gradescope).
* While the lab explains how to use HTTPS to clone and access your repository on GitHub, we recommend you eventually set up `SSH access <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`__ for your GitHub account.

At a later time (probably once you're done with Project 1a), you may also want to work through the `Advanced Git lab <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/advanced-git/>`__ from CMSC 22000.

Once you have mastered branches and merging, you may want to read `A successful Git branching model <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__.

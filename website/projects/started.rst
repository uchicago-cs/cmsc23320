Projects - Getting Started
--------------------------


Before working on the projects, you should read the `UChicago CS Developer Guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/>`__. In particular, please note the following:

- You must use a `CS Software Environment <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/environment.html>`__ in this class. We may not be able to provide support if you develop and run your code in a different environment. Please note that there are multiple mechanisms to access a CS software environment remotely.

  You can also run your development environment of choice on your personal computer, and connect to a CS machine only to compile, run, and test your code. This is particularly easy to set up using `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__. You can check out the following `guide <https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2021/fall/12100-1/resources/vscode.html>`__ (from CMSC 12100) on how to install Visual Studio Code, and how to set it up to SSH into a CS environment.

- Project 3 involves using a network simulator that requires root access on a Linux machine. In the past, we have provided a `virtual machine <https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/vm:index>`__ for Project 3 so you could run code with root privileges; this year, we are exploring a few alternate mechanisms that may not involve installing a full virtual machine but, in case we do still have to use the virtual machine, you may want to ensure (well ahead of Project 3) that you are able to install and use the CS virtual machine.

- The `C style guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html>`__ in the CS Developer Guide is the normative style guide for this class.

Make sure you understand how `project registration and submission <registering_submitting.html>`__ works.

Make sure you follow our instructions for `adding a project's initial code <initial_code.html>`__ to a repository.

The following resources may also be helpful when working on your projects:

* `Using Git <../resources/git.html>`__: If you are new to Git, you can work through an optional lab to familiarize yourself with Git, as well as with GitHub Classroom (which we will use to manage the course repositories).
* `The Debugging Guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/>`__: A guide with useful suggestions and pointers on how to debug your C code.
* `Asking Questions <../resources/questions.html>`__: A guide to asking effective questions on Ed Discussion.

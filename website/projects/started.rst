Projects - Getting Started
--------------------------

Before working on the projects, we recommend you check out the `UChicago CS Student Resource Guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/>`__. In particular, please note the following:

- You must use a `CS Software Environment <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/environment/environment.html>`__ in this class. We may not be able to provide support if you develop and run your code in a different environment. The Student Resource Guide describes several ways of accessing a CS Software Environment (including remote options).

  You can also run your development environment of choice on your personal computer, and connect to a CS machine only to compile, run, and test your code. This is particularly easy to set up using `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__. The Student Resource Guide includes instructions on how to set up Visual Studio Code, and how to set it up to SSH into a CS environment.

- If you are new to Git, you should work through the `Git Basics Tutorial <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/tutorials/git-basics.html>`__ to familiarize yourself with Git.

- You will need to set up SSH access to your GitHub repositories. If you worked through
  the `Git Basics <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/tutorials/git-basics.html>`__ tutorial, then you will have already done this. If not, you can find instructions
  at the start of the tutorial, but you can also refer to Github's
  documentation on `Connecting to GitHub with SSH <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`__

- Project 3 involves using a network simulator that requires root access on a Linux machine. In the past, we have provided a `virtual machine <https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/vm:index>`__ for Project 3 so you could run code with root privileges; this year, we are exploring a few alternate mechanisms that may not involve installing a full virtual machine but, in case we do still have to use the virtual machine, you may want to ensure (well ahead of Project 3) that you are able to install and use the CS virtual machine.

- The `C style guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html>`__ in the Student Resource Guide is the normative style guide for this class.

- When asking questions on Ed Discussion, you must follow the guidelines in the `Asking Questions <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/getting-help/questions.html>`__ page in the Student Resource Guide.

- `The Debugging Guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/>`__, linked from the guide, contains useful suggestions and pointers on how to debug your C code.

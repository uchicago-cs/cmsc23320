Project Registration
--------------------

For each project, a Git repository will be created for you and your project partner on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__, a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. However, before that repository can be created for you, you need to have a GitHub account. If you do not yet have one, you can get an account here: https://github.com/join. Once you create your account, you may want to get the `Student Developer Pack <https://education.github.com/pack>`__, which will give you access to a lot of other features (please note that having the Student Developer Pack is not necessary for this class; it's just a nice benefit you get as a student)

If you're unfamiliar with Git, make sure to read our `Using Git <../resources/git.hml>`__ page before proceeding further.

To actually get your private repository, you will need an *invitation URL*, which we will provide through Ed Discussion when each project is released. When you click on an invitation URL, you will have to complete the following steps:

1. You will need to select your CNetID from a list. This will allow us to know what student is associated with each GitHub account. This step is only done for the very first invitation you accept.
2. Next, you will need to create a new team, or join an existing team if your project partner has already created a team. Please make sure to coordinate with your project partner so you do not end up creating two separate teams.

   Please note that, while GitHub will allow you to select an arbitrary team name, your team name **must** be the project number (``p1``, ``p2``, or ``p3``, followed by your CNetIDs in alphabetical order and separated by a hyphen (e.g., ``p1-jdoe-jrandom``).
3. Finally, you must click "Accept this assignment" or your repository will not actually be created.
4. Once the repository has been created you **must** follow our instructions for `adding the project's initial code <initial_code.html>`__ to the repository.

If you run into any issues, or need us to make any manual adjustments to your registration, please let us know via Ed Discussion.

Project Submission
------------------

Before submitting, make sure you've added, committed, and pushed all your code to GitHub. You will submit your code through `Gradescope <https://gradescope.com/>`__, which you can access through our Canvas site.

When submitting through Gradescope, you will be given the option of manually uploading files, or of uploading a GitHub repository (we recommend the latter, as this ensures you are uploading exactly the files that are in your repository). If you upload your repository, make sure you select the appropriate repository, with "master" as the branch. Please note that you can submit as many times as you want before the deadline.

Once you submit your files, an "autograder" will run. This autograder should produce the same test results as when you run the code yourself; if it doesn't, please let us know so we can look into it.

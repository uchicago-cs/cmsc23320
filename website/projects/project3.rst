Project 3: chirouter
--------------------

In this project you will be implementing a simple IP router capable of routing IPv4 datagrams between multiple networks. This router will have a static routing table, so you will not have to deal with implementing a routing protocol like RIP or OSPF; instead, the project will focus on the routing of IP datagrams. While, at a high level, this just involves receiving IP datagrams and figuring out what interface they should be sent on, this requires building additional functionality before you can actually start routing IP datagrams.

Please refer to the following documents to complete this project:

- `chirouter specification <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chitcp/>`__
- `Project 3 rubric <project3_rubric.html>`__
- `Project 3 tips <project3_tips.html>`__

Take into account that this project requires using a network simulator that
needs to be run with root privileges on a Linux machine. If you do not have
access to such a machine, you can use the `CS Virtual Machine <https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/vm:index>`__
(version 202122.2 or higher) to run the network simulator. This virtual
machine will only work on computers with Intel processors so, if you are running
a newer Mac with an M1 processor, please see our Ed Discussion site for instructions
on how to set up a virtual machine on your computer.

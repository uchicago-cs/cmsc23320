Project 1: chirc
----------------

In this project, you will implement a simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
server called chirc. This project has three goals:

#. To learn how to program with sockets, as well as some basic concurrent programming
   (including refreshing some concepts covered in CMSC 15400)

#. To implement a system that is (partially) compliant with an
   established network protocol specification.

#. To allow you to become comfortable with high-level networking
   concepts before we move on to the lower-level concepts in this
   course.

Please refer to the following documents to complete this project:

- `chirc specification <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/>`__. Please
  note that you will specifically be implementing the following "assignments" from the chirc specification:

  - Project 1a: `Assignment 1 <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/assignment1.html>`__
  - Project 1b: `Assignment 4 <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/assignment4.html>`__

- `Project 1 rubric <project1_rubric.html>`__
- `Project 1 tips <project1_tips.html>`__

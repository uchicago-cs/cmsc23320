<p>The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our <a class="reference external" href="../syllabus.html#grading">Grading</a> section of
the syllabus for more details.</p>
<p>This project has two submissions: Project 2A and Project 2B. You will receive two SNU scores
for each submission:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Completeness score</strong>: This score will be determined solely by the result of running
the automated tests, as these give a measure of how <em>complete</em> your implementation
is (i.e., how much of the assignment you implemented).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Quality score</strong>: This score is determined by a review of your code done by
the course staff, and is based on three aspects of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Correctness</em>: This encompasses issues with your code
that, while not explicitly captured by the tests, could lead to
incorrect or inefficient behaviour in your code. This can include
small mistakes in your code, as well as larger issues that reveal
a lack of mastery in the material.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Design</em>: This encompasses
“qualities, many of which are intangible, that don’t have to do with (and exist
to some extent independently of) the correct operation of your code.” (thanks to
Adam Shaw for this concise phrasing).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Style</em>: This encompasses your adherence
to our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="submission-timeline">
<h1>Submission Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-timeline" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The exact timeline of submissions will be the following:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Submission</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Requirements</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Due Date</p></th>

</table>
<p>Project 2A will likely not be graded until after Project 2B is due. Once Project 2B is graded,
you will have an opportunity to make a resubmission for Project 2A and/or 2B (and, at that point,
you will have feedback for both Project 2A and 2B). We will
post more details about the resubmission process at a later time.</p>
</section>
<section id="completeness">
<h1>Completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#completeness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Completeness component will be determined by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">grade</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(see <a class="reference external" href="http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chitcp/testing.html#automated-tests">Automated tests</a>
in the chiTCP documentation and, specifically, the “Producing a grade report” section
for more details)</p>
<p>Your SNU score will then be determined as follows:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Grade</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Points on tests</p></th>

<section id="code-quality">
<h1>Code Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#code-quality" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing your code quality, there are a number of things we will be paying
close attention to, and which we describe in the sections below (including major
issues, labelled “[Major Issue]” that you should be particularly mindful of).</p>
<p>Please note that, since Project 2B builds on Project 2A, all rubric items in
Project 2A also apply on Project 2B.</p>
<p>In general, your SNU score will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong>: Your submission has a few of the issues described below (but no
major issues).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong>: Your submission has several of the issues described below,
or at least one major issue. In general, major revisions are typically required to
get up to an S.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unsatisfactory</strong>: Your submission does not constitute a good-faith effort to complete
the work. This includes not submitting any work at all, as well as submitting
only placeholder code (e.g., code that includes functions for all the required
IRC commands, but where the functions are empty or filled with “TODO”s, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, while the issues listed below are the main things we care about in this project,
it is not possible for us to give you an exhaustive list of every single thing that could
affect your code quality score. If you get a comment pointing out an issue in your
code that we did not list below, take it as an opportunity to improve your work
(and remember that you’ll have a chance to revise your work!)</p>
</section>
<section id="correctness">
<h1>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing the correctness of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following issues:</p>
<section id="general">
<h2>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Not setting a correct value for SEG.WND</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not updating SND.WND when a packet arrives</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not locking the pending packet mutex before accessing the list of pending packets</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not freeing packets once you’re done with them</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sending a packet that doesn’t conform to the RFC</strong> (even if it happens to pass the tests). This can include setting incorrect flags, such as setting the SYN flag after the three-way handshake is done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Making a state transition inconsistent with the RFC</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incorrect code for checking a condition specified in the RFC</strong>. For example, when comparing values, using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> even when the RFC says to check for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;=</span></code>. This rubric item also encompasses coding mistakes that result in a condition ultimately being checked incorrectly (e.g., writing something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">c</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a&lt;b</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="pre">b&lt;c</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not locking the pending packets mutex before accessing the pending packets list.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<section id="project-2a-3-way-handshake">
<h2>[Project 2A] 3-way Handshake<a class="headerlink" href="#project-2a-3-way-handshake" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Acknowledging the final ACK in the 3-way handshake</strong>. Remember that acknowledgements are not acknowledged in TCP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not checking that the SYN was acknowledged before sending the ACK and changing state to ESTABLISHED</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3-way Handshake: Setting the ISS to a constant value, instead of using a random number.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Writing a 3-way handshake by rote that doesn’t check the TCP header values, and assumes that the first three messages exchanged must be a SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK</strong>. For example, you could technically pass the three-way handshake tests by making TCP go into an ESTABLISHED state after receiving two packets (without checking whether the first one is a SYN packet, and whether the second one contains a valid ACK).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="project-2a-data-transfer">
<h2>[Project 2A] Data Transfer<a class="headerlink" href="#project-2a-data-transfer" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Not checking if the value of SEG.ACK and SEG.SEQ is correct</strong>. In some cases, no action needs to be taken when a value is incorrect, but we still recommend (but not require) that you chilog() any such cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not setting the ACK flag and including a valid acknowledgement number in every packet after the 3-way handshake</strong>. Remember that, even if you haven’t received any new data, you still have to send a valid acknowledgement number in every segment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not updating SND.UNA and SND.WND with SEG.ACK and SEG.WND for every incoming packet with a valid SEG.ACK</strong></p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Unconditionally sending an ACK segment in reply to every segment that is received</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not updating the value of RCV.WND in the APPLICATION_RECEIVE event</strong></p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Not taking SND.WND into account when processing the send buffer</strong>. You should make sure to never send more bytes than allowed by the effective window (remember this won’t be just SND.WND, but is computed based on SND.WND).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not segmenting the data in the send buffer into MSS-sized packets (536 bytes), or segmenting it incorrectly</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="project-2a-connection-teardown">
<h2>[Project 2A] Connection teardown<a class="headerlink" href="#project-2a-connection-teardown" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Not handling the APPLICATION_CLOSE event in both ESTABLISHED and CLOSE_WAIT</strong>. In both cases, you should only send a FIN packet if there is no data left in the send buffer, but you should transition to FIN-WAIT-1 / LAST-ACK (respectively) right away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not delaying the FIN packet until all outstanding data has been sent and acknowledged</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not handling the APPLICATION_RECEIVE event in FIN_WAIT_1 and FIN_WAIT_2</strong>. TCP can still receive data in those states, which means the application may still call <cite>recv</cite>.</p></li>

<h2>[Project 2B] Managing the Retransmission Queue<a class="headerlink" href="#project-2b-managing-the-retransmission-queue" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Adding pure ACK packets (i.e., not SYN or FIN segments, nor segments with a payload) to the retransmission queue</strong>. ACK packets are not retransmitted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adding segments with a payload to the retransmission queue, but not adding SYN or FIN segments</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not removing acknowledged packets from the retransmission queue</strong>. Take into account that multiple packets could be removed because of a cumulative ack. However, you should not automatically remove all the packets from the retransmission queue whenever you receive an ACK, because you could have packets 1-10 in the queue, and receive an acknowledgement only for 1-5.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unnecessarily locking the retransmission queue</strong>. The retransmission queue is only ever accessed by the socket thread, so there is no possibility of concurrent access by multiple threads. So, it does not need to be protected by a mutex.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unconditionally setting the timer every time a packet is sent</strong>. You should set the timer only if you are sending a packet with data (or a SYN or FIN) <em>and</em> the timer is not already active. If the timer is already active, then sending new data doesn’t affect the timer in any way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not cancelling the timer when all outstanding data has been acknowledged</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconditionally restarting the timer when any ACK is received</strong>. The timer should only be restarted when the ACK acknowledges outstanding data.</p></li>

<section id="design">
<h1>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing the design of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Not writing a packet arrival handler</strong>. You should structure your code so that you have a single <a class="reference external" href="project2_tips.html#writing-the-packet-arrival-handler">packet arrival handler</a> that gets called from any state where a packet arrives.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Writing a packet arrival handler that does not follow the exact SEGMENT ARRIVES logic in the RFC.</strong> Most notably, you should not try to reverse-engineer the logic in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SEGMENT</span> <span class="pre">ARRIVES</span></code> to figure our the steps to follow based on the current TCP state (the RFC does indicate a number of steps that will depend on the TCP state, but you should check for the value of the TCP state when the RFC tells you to, instead of combing through the logic and trying to extract the steps that only apply to a given state).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing a packet arrival handler, but still having some of the packet arrival handler logic in the state handling functions</strong>. That said, we will allow some of the packet arrival handling logic to appear in the CLOSED, LISTEN, and SYN-SENT states (and the rest in a packer arrival handler), given that the RFC specifies a specific treatment for those three states, whereas the rest of the states are lumped together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not writing a function to process the send buffer</strong>. Based on the TCP variables, this function should decide whether to send any packets or not. This function should be called when handling APPLICATION_SEND, and whenever SND.UNA or SND.WND changes (since that may open up the window, allowing more data to be sent).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Destroying the multitimer thread each time a single timer expires</strong>. Your multitimer should have a single thread that should not be stopped/re-recreated at any point (it should just be stopped when calling mt_free, once we’re completely done using the multitimer). Most notably, you should not destroy the thread when a single timer expires (to then create a thread when setting the next timer)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inefficient access to the next expiring timer</strong>. It should be possible to determine the next expiring timer in O(1) time. It is ok to have a data structure that requires more than O(1) time to add/remove an active timer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inefficient access to a timer by ID</strong>. It should be possible to access a timer by ID in O(1) time.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Implementing the multitimer with busy waiting instead of using condition variables</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complicated callback functions for the retransmission timer or the persist timer</strong>. These callback functions should be little more than a call to chitcpd_timeout, and should include little (if any) retransmission/persist logic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Repeating retransmission logic in multiple places</strong>. Your code should be structured in such a way that you only need to add segments to the retransmission queue in a single point in your code (e.g., by having a “send packet” function that also takes care of adding the packet to the retransmission queue if necessary).</p></li>

<section id="style">
<h1>Style<a class="headerlink" href="#style" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>We will be checking your general adherence to
our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>
and, while we will not be checking that you follow every minute aspect of our
style guide, we do expect you to follow a <em>consistent</em> style that
asymptotically approaches the one specified in our style guide.
That said, there <em>are</em> certain aspects we will be paying more
attention to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Documenting functions</strong>: Every function written by you must have
a <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#function-comments">function comment</a> with a brief description
of what the function does, and a description of the parameters and the
return value. Please note that not documenting your functions at all
(as opposed to doing so inconsistently or not following the style guide)
is considered a major issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent indentation</strong>: Your code must follow one of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#indentation">allowed indentation styles</a> consistently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: Your code must be easy to read and understand. This
is a fairly subjective aspect, but remember that things like using
variable names without descriptive names or using magic numbers will
usually make your code harder to read.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using global variables</strong>, except when defining
compile-time constants.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using goto statements</strong>, except in the very limited cases
described in the style guide.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="other-code-quality-issues">
<h1>Other Code Quality Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#other-code-quality-issues" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are a couple of other issues that we care about across all projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reinventing wheels that don’t need to be reinvented</strong>: In this class, we expect
you to know how to use data structures like linked lists, hash tables, etc.
(and how to choose the right data structure for a given task). However, this is a Networks class,
not a Data Structures class, and you should <em>not</em> be spending any time implementing
such data structures. The projects largely use the following data structure
implementations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html">utlist</a>: A linked list library</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/">uthash</a>: A hash table for C structures</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antirez/sds">SDS</a>: Simple Dynamic Strings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing your own linked list, hash table, etc. from scratch is considered
a major issue. While you may think that implementing your own data structure
is a worthwhile exercise, it invariably results in more work for the TAs and graders
(as you will likely run into all sorts of issues and segfaults that could have been
avoided by using a well-known and well-tested data structures library). Plus, it will
be a much more worthwhile experience for you to understand how to incorporate an existing library
into your own code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Submitting code that doesn’t build</strong>: If you submit code that does not build
on Gradescope’s autograder, but the graders can get it to build with some minor fixes
(missing semicolons, parenthesis, etc.),
this will just be treated as a major issue. However, if your code
requires substantial work to get it to build, you will receive a U score.</p>
<p><strong>So, make sure you verify that the version of the code you submitted builds correctly on a supported
software environment</strong> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page for more details on this)
Additionally, it is your responsibility to check that the code you submitted to Gradescope
builds correctly. If it doesn’t, but it builds correctly on your end, please let us
know so we can look into it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using printf instead of chilog</strong>: All the projects in this class use a simple logging library called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> that is documented in each of the project specifications. You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions <em>exclusively</em> for printing logging or debug messages. <strong>Do not use printf() directly in your code</strong>. Please note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions provide essentially the same functionality as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>, so there is no situation where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code> would be necessary instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> consistently also means you will not have to scrub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>’s from your code before submitting it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the messages at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CRITICAL</span></code> levels must be used only for their intended purposes (e.g., only use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> to print out actual errors in the execution of your program). You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level only to print informative debug messages that would be understood by any developer trying to debug your code. You may use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level to print <em>any</em> debug message (including those that would only be understood by you). However, if your code is riddled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statements (including commented out ones) to the point where it is hard to read the code itself, we may penalize you for this. So, once a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statement has served its purpose, we suggest you remove it (not just comment it out).</p>
<p>You should assume that graders will run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> level, and will only use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level if they need to debug an issue with your code. We will never run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Please note that, in assignments where you are responsible for writing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function, you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> to print to <em>standard error</em> if there is an error that prevents the program from starting (e.g., if a command-line parameter has not been provided, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Grossly incorrect memory management</strong>: You should make sure
to free any memory you malloc, but we will usually not penalize you unless you’ve
been grossly negligent in your malloc’ing/freeing. You should also make sure to
not “save” pointers to stack-allocated memory that is going to be deallocated.
This can happen if you store a pointer to a functions’ local variable in a struct
that is heap-allocated.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="resubmission">
<h1>Resubmission<a class="headerlink" href="#resubmission" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When you receive your graded Project 2B, you can make a resubmission to address
any feedback you received in Projects 2A and/or 2B. This may increase your scores
in those projects.</p>
<p>Note: You <em>cannot</em> make a resubmission if you got S’s on both Completeness and Code Quality. If you
are in this situation and want additional feedback on your grading, please ask on Ed.</p>
<p>While the project is divided into two parts (2A and 2B), remember that Project 2B
builds on Project 2A, As such, you should think about your
resubmission as a final cumulative submission that addresses any remaining issues
in your Project 2A and/or 2B submissions (i.e., you should not think in terms
of making two separate resubmissions, one for 2A and another for 2B, with different
code for each submission).</p>
<p>Making a resubmission involves not just addressing the feedback we gave you, but
also preparing some documentation explaining the changes you made to your code.
You should consider this documentation as important as the changes you are making
to your code: <strong>resubmissions that do not include the information requested below
WILL NOT BE GRADED</strong>.</p>
<p>If you decide to make a resubmission, you <strong>MUST</strong> add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RESUBMISSION.md</span></code> file
in the root of your repository using the following template: (the exact sections
are explained below)</p>
<div class="highlight-markdown notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gh">Project 1 Resubmission</span>

<p>Below you can find more details on each of the sections. If you are not providing any
information in a given section, please do not remove the section. Instead, just write
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N/A</span></code> below it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Team members</strong>: Ordinarily, this would be the same two team members who made the original submission.
However, if you worked individually on the resubmission (because your teammate was happy with the
original submission, and didn’t want to work further on it), please make sure to note this here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resubmission for…</strong>: Indicate what submission(s) should be regraded based on this code
(see the “Submission” section below for more details). To check the checkboxes, replace <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code>
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[X]</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubric items you have addressed</strong>: Rubric items that appear selected on Gradescope (under “Manual Grading”)
represent issues that had an impact on your Code Quality score. To facilitate the work of the
graders, you must list each rubric item you have addressed, with the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The rubric item description, exactly as it appears on Gradescope.</p></li>
<li><p>1-2 sentences explaining how you addressed the rubric item.</p></li>
<li><p>If the work you did on the rubric item is limited to a few lines of code, specify the filename and line number(s),
If your work on this rubric item involved deeper changes to your code, you do not need to list every single line
of code you changed, but you should try to give the graders a general sense of where you made the changes, including
a few examples if possible
(e.g., “I combed through the code to make sure I was using descriptive variable names; for example, I changed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">packet</span></code> in several functions”, “I reorganized functions <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar()</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baz()</span></code> as requested”, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that the Project 2A rubric items are a subset of the Project 2B rubric items. This means that…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If your initial Project 2B submission already addressed a rubric item from Project 2A (and the rubric
item was no longer selected in your graded Project 2B), it is enough to say “This rubric item was addressed
in Project 2B”</p></li>
<li><p>If you scored an N in Code Quality in Project 2A, but then scored an S in Code Quality
in Project 2B, you do not need to explain how you addressed each individual rubric item.
Instead, please include the following text in this section: “We earned an S in Code Quality
in Project 2B”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rubric items you have NOT addressed</strong>: It is also important that you let us know what rubric items you
decided not to address, as this will expedite the work of the graders. For these rubric items, it is enough
to provide a list of the rubric item descriptions (exactly as they appear on Gradescope)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Substantial new code added to your submission</strong>: If you added substantial new code that was not present in your
original submission (e.g., if your original submission did not implement several commands, and you have now included
new code to implement those commands), you must specify the affected files, as well as the new functionality that
is added by the new code. For example, you could include something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Modified</span> <span class="n">files</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">h</span>

<span class="n">Fleshed</span> <span class="n">out</span> <span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">retransmissions</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">work</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span>

<span class="n">Added</span> <span class="n">functions</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">Y</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">Z</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">implement</span> <span class="n">out</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">order</span> <span class="n">delivery</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changes made to pass additional tests</strong>: If you made changes to your code with the goal of passing more tests,
please specify your original test score, and the new test score. If your work only involved a few minor bug fixes,
please let us know you did this (but you do not need to specify the exact changes you made). On the other hand,
if you skipped parts of Project 2B in your original submission, and have written entirely new code, please make
sure you have specified this as part of the “substantial new code”, and that you also specify that doing so
allowed you to pass additional tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other changes</strong>: If you made other changes to your code, such as refactoring large parts of your code, make
sure to specify this too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, if you do not include a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RESUBMISSION.md</span></code> file with the above information,
your resubmission <strong>will not be graded</strong>.</p>
<section id="submitting">
<h2>Submitting<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>For technical reasons, there will be two separate resubmission assignments on Gradescope: “Project 2A (resubmission)”
and “Project 2B (resubmission)”:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you want to improve your score in both Project 2A and 2B, <strong>you must submit the same code
to both assignments</strong>. We will only review the code in the 2B submission, but will use the 2A
resubmission assignment to convey your updated scores for Project 2A.</p></li>
<li><p>If you only need to improve your score in one (but not both) of the assignments, submit
your code <em>only</em> in the corresponding resubmission assignment. e.g., if you are happy with
your Project 2A score, but want to improve your Project 2B score, then you only need to
make a submission to the “Project 2B (resubmission)” assignment on Gradescope.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="resubmission-grading">
<h2>Resubmission Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#resubmission-grading" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, if you are making a resubmission that only involved addressing rubric items, without adding substantial
new code to your submission, there is a very high likelihood that addressing all the rubric items will bump your Code
Quality score to an S. You may leave up to two non-major rubric items unaddressed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are making a resubmission that involves adding substantial new code, please bear in mind
that the graders could identify issues in that new code that will impact your Code Quality score. Please
make sure to carefully review the <a class="reference external" href="project2_rubric.html">Project 2 Rubric</a> so you know what the graders will be looking at.</p>

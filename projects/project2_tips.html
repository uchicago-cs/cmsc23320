<h1>Project 2 Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#project-2-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Before you get started, make sure you’ve read through the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page.</p>
<div class="section" id="interpreting-rfc-793">
<h2>Interpreting RFC 793<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-rfc-793" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this project, you will be implementing TCP, which is specified in <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a>.
Like many network protocols, certain aspects of the specification may be unclear. When you run into such an issue,
you should first check <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>: it provides corrections and clarifications
on RFC 793. If you are still unclear on how to proceed, then ask on Piazza: we will provide an ex cathedra ruling
on how you should interpret the RFC.</p>
<p>That said, there are parts of the RFC that <em>do</em> provide unambiguous formulas.
Sometimes, students will tweak this formulas as they try to debug their code
(e.g., using &lt;= instead of &lt;). This may make your code work for the issue you
are trying to resolve, but will probably cause issues down the road.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important that you implement TCP as specified in the RFC, not your
interpretation of TCP (based on class notes and examples online). Replicating the
behaviour of simple examples (like the 3-way handshake) may work for simple
operations, but is not a good strategy for implementing all of TCP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-the-packet-arrival-handler">
<h2>Writing the Packet Arrival Handler<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-the-packet-arrival-handler" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Writing the “packet arrival handler” (i.e., how TCP reacts when a packet arrives) is actually
pretty simple: you just have to translate pages 64-75 of the RFC into code. A common pitfall
is to write this handler as a gigantic if-else statement (with each branch corresponding to a
TCP state) where you implement your interpretation of what should happen in each state when
a packet arrives. Pages 64-75 methodically describe how to process a packet. Although some
parts of it do involve branching by state, you should not write a gigantic if-else as the
main structure of your packet arrival handler. As noted above, it is important that you
follow the RFC, not your high-level understanding of how TCP must work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tests-that-sometimes-pass-but-sometimes-don-t">
<h2>Tests that sometimes pass, but sometimes don’t<a class="headerlink" href="#tests-that-sometimes-pass-but-sometimes-don-t" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may sometimes run a test multiple times, and find that the test passes some times,
but not others. Frequently, you may find that your tests pass consistently when run
at a particular log level, but some (but not all) of them fail when run at a different
log level. The reason this can happen is because the sequence of events in a multithreaded
application (like chitcp) can change from one run to another. This is specially
apparent when changing logging levels, since the more verbose logging levels (like DEBUG
and TRACE) effectively inject substantial delays when a thread has to print logs.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you’ve established a connection, and peer A has to send 5 TCP
packets to peer B, and that peer B sends an ACK packet for each of those packets.
If you are running with no logging, B will probably send those packets right away so,
from peer A’s perspective, the sequence of events could be something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re running with heavy logging, B may take slightly longer to send back
the acknowledgements (because it’s spending CPU time printing out logs), so the sequence
of events could instead look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">SEND</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">RECEIVE</span> <span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">packet</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice how the events still happen in the correct order (the delays introduced by logging will
not result in packets being delivered <em>out of order</em>, which is something that would happen
at the network level), but the <em>interleaving</em> of the events is different. A correct implementation
of TCP should be able to handle either sequence of events, but
your code could have a subtle bug that only manifests itself when events happen in a particular
order.</p>
<p>When this happens, you should ideally try to identify the bug. Try to find the simplest possible
test where this issue manifests itself, and analyze why the test fails. Of course, this may
be challenging because your code may pass with DEBUG logging, but not with INFO logging (which
provides fewer clues on what could be wrong). This leads us to our next point…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pick-your-battles-a-k-a-it-is-ok-to-not-pass-all-the-tests">
<h2>Pick your battles (a.k.a.: “it is ok to not pass all the tests”)<a class="headerlink" href="#pick-your-battles-a-k-a-it-is-ok-to-not-pass-all-the-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Achieving a perfect implementation that can pass all the tests under every possible sequencing
of events is very challenging. It is very likely that many of you will end up passing nearly
all the tests, with a few stubborn tests that sometimes pass but sometimes don’t. More often than
not, this is due to bugs that are very hard to track down, because they only manifest themselves
under a specific ordering of events, and which typically require a very deep debugging session
to resolve.</p>
<p>We encourage you to pick your battles, and to consider whether going down a debugging
rabbit hole for several hours is a sensible use of your time for just a few testing points (for
context, one test point accounts for 0.15% of your final grade. That is time that
could be spent on polishing up your code, documenting it, etc. which is likely to have a bigger
impact on your grade for this project.</p>
<p>That said, if you are in a situation where you consistently get a high score on the tests
under a specific logging level, you are allowed to mention this in the README file in the root of
your repository, requesting
that the graders run the tests under that logging level (you may <em>not</em> request that they run
some tests under one logging level, and other tests under a different logging level). Please
make sure to also include the output of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">grade</span></code>, so the graders can ensure they’re
observing the same scores you’re seeing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dealing-with-zero-windows">
<h2>Dealing with Zero Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-zero-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Until you get to Project 2b, your code will have no way of dealing with a host that is advertising a window
of zero bytes (a common way of dealing with this is by sending
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPWindowManagementIssues-3.htm">probe segments</a>). So, if a host does advertise
a window with zero bytes, your TCP may get stuck. The tests are designed to avoid, as much as possible, this situation,
but it may still arise (and will do so sporadically, since it requires a specific sequence of events to happen). We
suggest you add something like this wherever you update the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SND_WND</span></code> variable:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tcp_data</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">SND_WND</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">chilog</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CRITICAL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Zero window received. TCP may become stuck.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you run a test, and it sporadically times out because of this (but works most of the times), you should not worry
about this, and should consider the test passed.</p>
<p>Note that this situation is different from the <em>effective window</em> being equal to zero: this can happen when the sender
has sent enough data to fill the window, but the receiving host may open the window by acknowledging the data or
by advertising a new window size. It may not be uncommon for the effective window to be zero at times, and what
you need to check for is whether the <em>advertised window</em> ever becomes zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="origin-of-log-messages">
<h2>Origin of log messages<a class="headerlink" href="#origin-of-log-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tcp-socket-N</span></code> log messages originate in your TCP thread (where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> is the socket number)</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">socket-layer-N</span></code> log messages originate in the socket layer of the protocol stack (the one that
handles send(), recv(), connect(), etc.). The socket layer is the one that calls your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tcp_data_init</span></code>
function so, in the second part of the project, your timer thread will inherit the same name unless
you specifically set a new name for the timer thread. To make your logs clearer, you can do so by
setting the name of the timer thread with this code (at the start of the timer thread function):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">char</span> <span class="n">thread_name</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="n">snprintf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thread_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;timer-</span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ptr_to_fd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">si</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">entry</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="n">pthread_setname_np</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pthread_self</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">thread_name</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That should make the logs a bit easier to interpret, because you’ll know when a message is coming
from the socket layer and when it’s coming from the timer thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-random-tests">
<h2>The random tests<a class="headerlink" href="#the-random-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the second part of the project, the random tests are <em>pretty difficult</em> to debug, because a
lot ends up happening in them (much more than in any of the other tests). They should be the
very last tests you try to pass, and you should not approach them until all the other tests
are passing <em>including all the tests from the first part of the project</em> (if you are failing
any of the other tests, it is likely you will also fail the random tests). Please note that
it will be hard to help you with the random tests if you are not already passing all the other
tests; when this happens, please ask for help on those (non-random) tests first.</p>
<p>Please note that the random tests are actually deterministic, because they use the same random
seed every time. However, the packets are dropped according to a random number generator, not
according to a specific well-defined situation (unlike the other unreliability tests, which
test specific situations like “dropping the SYN/ACK in the three-way handshake”, “dropping
only one packet during the data transfer”, etc.). Basically, if you can pass all the random
tests, that probably means your implementation is pretty solid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rtt-tests">
<h2>The RTT tests<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rtt-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The RTT estimation tests do not contribute to your test grade (the one you get when running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">grade</span></code>).
The reason for this is that these tests are trivial to pass if you just estimate the RTT to be zero
(ensuring your tests never time out). However, the graders will be running these tests and,
if you are not doing any RTT estimation (or if they find issues with the RTT estimation) they
will deduct points from the Correctness portion of the rubric (in fact, the rubric specifically
calls this out as something we’ll be looking at in p2b)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="common-pitfalls">
<h2>Common Pitfalls<a class="headerlink" href="#common-pitfalls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Calling tcp_data_init or tcp_data_free</strong>: You should never call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tcp_data_init</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tcp_data_free</span></code>
from your code. These functions are called by the socket layer (when a socket is created or destroyed),
and calling either of them a second time can produce unexpected results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Worrying about functionality that is handled in the socket or network layers</strong>: Since you are writing a TCP implementation that interacts with both a socket layer and a network layer, it can sometimes be challenging to tell what is the responsibility of each layer. In the past, some students have spent a considerable amount of effort worrying about things that were actually already handled for them in other layers, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>The source/destination ports</em>: You should not set or modify these fields of the TCP header. These
fields are actually set by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chitcpd_tcp_packet_create</span></code>, which will look at the ports associated with the socket,
and will fill in the correct ports in the TCP header. Additionally, none of your code should depend on the
value of the source/destination ports; the socket layer is in charge of delivering data to the correct process
(based on the destination port), and is also in charge of assigning
source ports (either because the port is specified in a call to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chisocket_bind</span></code> or because one is selected by
the socket layer in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chisocket_connect</span></code> when creating an active socket).</p>
<p>Take into account that, even if you don’t explicitly manipulate the port fields of the TCP header,
you will destroy that information if you zero out a TCP header <em>after</em> calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chitcpd_tcp_packet_create</span></code>.
If you do this, you will likely get the following error in the chitcpd logs: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;No</span> <span class="pre">socket</span> <span class="pre">listening</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">port</span> <span class="pre">0&quot;</span></code></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Reporting errors back to the application layer</em>: RFC 793 specifies, at various points, that certain errors should
be returned to the application layer. For example, under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SEND</span> <span class="pre">Call</span></code> specification (corresponding to chiTCP’s
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_SEND</span></code> event), the RFC specifies the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">FIN</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">WAIT</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">STATE</span>
<span class="n">FIN</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">WAIT</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="n">STATE</span>
<span class="n">CLOSING</span> <span class="n">STATE</span>
<span class="n">LAST</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ACK</span> <span class="n">STATE</span>
<span class="n">TIME</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">WAIT</span> <span class="n">STATE</span>

  <span class="n">Return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;error:  connection closing&quot;</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">service</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This does not mean that your handling of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_SEND</span></code> in those states should implement some error-handling
logic. For the most part, these kind of errors are handled either in the socket layer or the network layer. For
example, in the above case, if an application called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chisocket_send</span></code> on a socket that was in any of the
above states, the socket layer would return an error (and this event would never propagate to your state handling
functions).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Passive sockets</em>: The setup and management of passive sockets is handled by the socket layer, including the
creation of a new active socket when a passive socket receives a SYN packet. The sockets you will deal will
in your implementation will always be active sockets, resulting either from an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_CONNECT</span></code> event or
from a passive socket spawning an active socket after receiving a SYN packet.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not initializing the sequence number in the buffer</strong>: You need to initialize the initial sequence number of
the buffers with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">circular_buffer_set_seq_initial</span></code>. If you do not, functions <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">circular_buffer_first</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">circular_buffer_next</span></code> will return incoherent values.</p>
<p>Take into account that the initial sequence number of the buffers should be the same as the first sequence
number of sendable/received <em>data</em>. So, it would not be exactly ISS/IRS, because those are actually the
first “byte” used by the SYN (but which do not represent any actual data). So, you would initialize
them to ISS+1 and IRS+1.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Implementing stop-and-wait instead of sliding window, or ignoring the window size</strong>: In sliding window,
you send as much data as allowed by the receiver’s window (after accounting for any data that may already
be in flight). If you send one packet and wait for an ACK before sending the next one, you’re implementing
stop-and-wait, not sliding window. If, on the other hand, you do send multiple packets at once, but send
more data than allowed by the window, this will likely result in undefined behaviour. An easy way to
check this is to see whether, at the start of the tests that send more than 4KB, your code send only
4KB and doesn’t send more data until it receives a first ACK. If you send (for example) 32KB all at
once, then you’re ignoring the windows size.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sending only one packet when segmentizing</strong>: Whenever you process the send buffer, you should always
send as many packets as possible without exceeding the receiver’s advertised window. A common pitfall
is to correctly identify that the send buffer contains more than one MSS of data, but then sending
only that first MSS, instead of sending as many packets allowed by SND.WND.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sending only when the APPLICATION_SEND event happens</strong>: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_SEND</span></code> event simply
informs TCP that the application has called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send()</span></code>, which means there is likely new data to
send, and you should send it if possible. However, this is <em>not</em> the only time you’ll want to
process the send buffer to send data. If the values of SND.UNA or SND.WND change (in general,
if the window shifts or grows), it may be possible for you to send more data to the other peer.
It is a good strategy to write a separate function that handles this task (“check the send
buffer and determine whether any data can be sent and, if so, send it”), and call it not just
from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_SEND</span></code> handler but also whenever SND.UNA or SND.WND change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not setting/reading the window variables</strong>: Every TCP packet you send must include a valid
value for SEG.WND. This is true regardless of whether the size of the receive buffer has
changed since the last TCP packet, and regardless of whether the packet carries a payload
or not. The value of SEG.WND is always set to the available space in the receive buffer.</p>
<p>Similarly, the value of SND.WND is always updated when you receive a valid TCP packet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not delaying the FIN packet</strong>: When an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_CLOSE</span></code> event happens, you <em>only</em>
send a FIN packet if the send buffer is empty. If the send buffer still has
unacknowledged/unsent data, you don’t send the FIN packet until the send buffer is empty.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is not enough to simply process your send buffer from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_CLOSE</span></code>
to clear the buffer, because the receiver’s window may not allow you to do this at that
point. So, you have to take into account that the send buffer may not become empty
until <em>after</em> you’ve processed the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">APPLICATION_CLOSE</span></code> event.</p>

<h1>Project 1 Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#project-1-rubric" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our <a class="reference external" href="../syllabus.html#grading">Grading</a> section of
the syllabus for more details.</p>
<p>This project has two submissions: Project 1A and Project 1B. You will receive two SNU scores
for each submission:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Completeness score</strong>: This score will be determined solely by the result of running
the automated tests, as these give a measure of how <em>complete</em> your implementation
is (i.e., how much of the assignment you implemented).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Quality score</strong>: This score is determined by a review of your code done by
the course staff, and is based on three aspects of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Correctness</em>: This encompasses issues with your code
that, while not explicitly captured by the tests, could lead to
incorrect or inefficient behaviour in your code. This can include
small mistakes in your code, as well as larger issues that reveal
a lack of mastery in the material.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Design</em>: This encompasses
“qualities, many of which are intangible, that don’t have to do with (and exist
to some extent independently of) the correct operation of your code.” (thanks to
Adam Shaw for this concise phrasing).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Style</em>: This encompasses your adherence
to our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This project also has a “Warm-up” submission. This submission does not contribute
to your final grade but, if you complete it, you will be more likely to get an S in Project 1A.
To complete the “Warm-up” submission, you must score at least 90/100 points on the autograder
for that submission.</p>
<section id="submission-timeline">
<h2>Submission Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-timeline" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The exact timeline of submissions will be the following:</p>

<p>You will receive some early feedback from the Project 1 Warm-up before Project 1A is due.</p>
<p>Project 1A will likely not be graded until after Project 1B is due. Once Project 1B is graded,
you will have an opportunity to make a resubmission for Project 1A and/or 1B (and, at that point,
you will have feedback for both Project 1A and 1B). We will
post more details about the resubmission process at a later time.</p>

<h2>Code Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#code-quality" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When assessing your code quality, there are a number of things we will be paying
close attention to, and which we describe in the sections below (including major
issues, labelled “[Major Issue]” that you should be particularly mindful of).</p>
<p>Please note that the items below refer to a complete Project 1
implementation (i.e., Assignments 1 and 4 of the chirc project), so some of the items
will not apply to the Intermediate Submission (most notably, you are not expected to use
threads or mutexes in that submission).</p>
<p>In general, your SNU score will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong>: Your submission has a few of the issues described below (but no
major issues).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong>: Your submission has several of the issues described below,
or at least one major issue. In general, major revisions are typically required to
get up to an S.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unsatisfactory</strong>: Your submission does not constitute a good-faith effort to complete
the work. This includes not submitting any work at all, as well as submitting
only placeholder code (e.g., code that includes functions for all the required
IRC commands, but where the functions are empty or filled with “TODO”s, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, while the issues listed below are the main things we care about in this project,
it is not possible for us to give you an exhaustive list of every single thing that could
affect your code quality score. If you get a comment pointing out an issue in your
code that we did not list below, take it as an opportunity to improve your work
(and remember that you’ll have a chance to revise your work!)</p>
<section id="correctness">
<h3>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When assessing the correctness of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<p><strong>All Submissions (including Warm-up)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Not checking the return value of send()</strong>: send is not guaranteed to send the entire buffer you provide, which you can only tell by looking at the return value (Beej’s Guide for Socket Programming provides a <a class="reference external" href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#sendall">ready-to-use solution to this</a>, which you’re welcome to use). Of course, send could also fail, and you need to check its return value for this too.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Not checking the return value of any socket function</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not using getaddrinfo to create the server socket</strong>. Please note that some of the socket examples we provide (most notably the first server example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oneshot-single.c</span></code>) manually create the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sockaddr</span></code> struct for the sake of highlighting what that struct looks like, but that is not the usual way to create a server socket. You can see an example of how to create a server socket with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getaddrinfo</span></code> in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uchicago-cs/cmsc23320/blob/master/samples/sockets/server-pthreads.c">server-pthreads.c</a> example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not using safe string functions (strncpy vs strcpy)</strong>: Most C string functions (strcpy, strcat, etc.) have an equivalent “safe” version (strncpy, strncat, etc.) where you can specify the maximum number of characters to copy/concatenate/etc. Use these instead to protect against accidental (or malicious) buffer overflows. Alternatively, consider using a string library like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antirez/sds">sds</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treating the return of recv() as a C-string</strong>: recv() returns the raw bytes received through the network. In a protocol like IRC, this happens to be human-readable commands, but recv() won’t return a C-string (i.e., an array of characters terminated by a NULL character). It is your responsibility to add that NULL terminator if you want to manipulate the bytes returned by recv() as a C-string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardcoding reply values that happen to make some tests pass</strong>, but which would fail
under reasonable use cases. Take into account that the chirc specification does allow you to
hardcode certain replies as a stop-gap measure (e.g., hardcoding the LUSERS replies during
connection registration, so you can make progress on those tests before you properly implement
the LUSERS command). However, you must ultimately remove those
hardcoded replies with a more general implementation. Finally, for avoidance of doubt,
there are also a few spots where the specification allows you to unconditionally hardcode
certain values; those can be left hardcoded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory accesses that could lead to segfaults under reasonable use cases</strong>. The graders won’t be
trying to make your code fail with bizarre corner cases but, for example, if there is a very evident
buffer overrun in your code, that will need to be fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not implementing something that is clearly specified in the project</strong>, even if
the tests don’t test for it (e.g., implementing a command almost completely,
but not implementing one of the replies).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project 1A and 1B</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Not protecting access to shared data structures (list/hash of channels, users, etc.) with a mutex</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using mutexes to protect access to data structures, but doing so inconsistently</strong> (e.g., locking the mutex only when writing to a data structure, and not when reading).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using mutexes to protect access to data structures, but not to socket accesses</strong>. See <a class="reference external" href="project1_tips.html#inadequate-locking">Inadequate locking</a> in the Project 1 tips for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Using a Big Fat Lock</strong> (i.e., using a single mutex lock for the entire server).</p></li>

</section>
<section id="design">
<h3>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When assessing the design of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<p><strong>All Submissions (including Warm-up)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>How you reassemble incoming messages</strong>: You should have some sort of array
for assembling the next message that will be processed, separate from the buffer
you pass to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recv()</span></code> function (which cannot be a 1-byte array; using a 1-byte
array when calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recv()</span></code> is considered a major issue).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project 1A and 1B</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>How you parse IRC commands</strong>: You should use the provided <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">message.c</span></code> module,
instead of rolling out your own parsing code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How you process IRC commands</strong>: You should use the provided <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">handlers.c</span></code> module,
instead of reinventing a message dispatching mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementing modules or structs that are already provided to you</strong>: Make sure you
don’t reinvent the wheel: we provide a lot of scaffolding code, and you should make
sure to use the data structures and functions provided to you.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Putting all your code inside the chirc_run function</strong>: This is fine
for the Project 1 Warm-up, but not once you move on to Project 1A</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="style">
<h3>Style<a class="headerlink" href="#style" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will be checking your general adherence to
our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>
and, while we will not be checking that you follow every minute aspect of our
style guide, we do expect you to follow a <em>consistent</em> style that
asymptotically approaches the one specified in our style guide.
That said, there <em>are</em> certain aspects we will be paying more
attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Documenting functions</strong>: Every function written by you must have
a <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#function-comments">function comment</a> with a brief description
of what the function does, and a description of the parameters and the
return value. Please note that not documenting your functions at all
(as opposed to doing so inconsistently or not following the style guide)
is considered a major issue.</p>
<p>Note: The chirc code uses <a class="reference external" href="https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html">Doxygen-style function comments</a>.
These are different from the ones in the style guide, but we will also accept
them if you want to follow that style instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent indentation</strong>: Your code must follow one of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#indentation">allowed indentation styles</a> consistently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: Your code must be easy to read and understand. This
is a fairly subjective aspect, but remember that things like using
variable names without descriptive names or using magic numbers will
usually make your code harder to read.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using global variables</strong>, except when defining
compile-time constants.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using goto statements</strong>, except in the very limited cases
described in the style guide.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="other-code-quality-issues">
<h3>Other Code Quality Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#other-code-quality-issues" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a couple of other issues that we care about across all projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reinventing wheels that don’t need to be reinvented</strong>: In this class, we expect
you to know how to use data structures like linked lists, hash tables, etc.
(and how to choose the right data structure for a given task). However, this is a Networks class,
not a Data Structures class, and you should <em>not</em> be spending any time implementing
such data structures. The projects largely use the following data structure
implementations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html">utlist</a>: A linked list library</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/">uthash</a>: A hash table for C structures</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antirez/sds">SDS</a>: Simple Dynamic Strings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing your own linked list, hash table, etc. from scratch is considered
a major issue. While you may think that implementing your own data structure
is a worthwhile exercise, it invariably results in more work for the TAs and graders
(as you will likely run into all sorts of issues and segfaults that could have been
avoided by using a well-known and well-tested data structures library). Plus, it will
be a much more worthwhile experience for you to understand how to incorporate an existing library
into your own code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Submitting code that doesn’t build</strong>: If you submit code that does not build
on Gradescope’s autograder, but the graders can get it to build with some minor fixes
(missing semicolons, parenthesis, etc.),
this will just be treated as a major issue. However, if your code
requires substantial work to get it to build, you will receive a U score.</p>
<p><strong>So, make sure you verify that the version of the code you submitted builds correctly on a supported
software environment</strong> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page for more details on this)
Additionally, it is your responsibility to check that the code you submitted to Gradescope
builds correctly. If it doesn’t, but it builds correctly on your end, please let us
know so we can look into it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using printf instead of chilog</strong>: All the projects in this class use a simple logging library called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> that is documented in each of the project specifications. You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions <em>exclusively</em> for printing logging or debug messages. <strong>Do not use printf() directly in your code</strong>. Please note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions provide essentially the same functionality as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>, so there is no situation where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code> would be necessary instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> consistently also means you will not have to scrub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>’s from your code before submitting it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the messages at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CRITICAL</span></code> levels must be used only for their intended purposes (e.g., only use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> to print out actual errors in the execution of your program). You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level only to print informative debug messages that would be understood by any developer trying to debug your code. You may use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level to print <em>any</em> debug message (including those that would only be understood by you). However, if your code is riddled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statements (including commented out ones) to the point where it is hard to read the code itself, we may penalize you for this. So, once a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statement has served its purpose, we suggest you remove it (not just comment it out).</p>
<p>You should assume that graders will run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> level, and will only use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level if they need to debug an issue with your code. We will never run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Please note that, in assignments where you are responsible for writing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function, you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> to print to <em>standard error</em> if there is an error that prevents the program from starting (e.g., if a command-line parameter has not been provided, etc.)</p>

<li><p><strong>Grossly incorrect memory management</strong>: You should make sure
to free any memory you malloc, but we will usually not penalize you unless you’ve
been grossly negligent in your malloc’ing/freeing. You should also make sure to
not “save” pointers to stack-allocated memory that is going to be deallocated.
This can happen if you store a pointer to a functions’ local variable in a struct
that is heap-allocated.</p></li>

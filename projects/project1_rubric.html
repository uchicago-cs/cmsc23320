<h1>Project 1 Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#project-1-rubric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Project 1 has not yet been updated for Winter 2022, and the rubric below refers to the old grading scheme
we used in this class. While you are welcome to read through this page, please bear in mind that the
grading scheme is being overhauled this year (see our <a class="reference external" href="../grading.html">Grading</a> page for more details).</p>
</div>
<p>This project is worth 15% of your final grade, and is divided into two parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Project 1a (Assignment 1 in chirc). Worth 5% of your final grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Project 1b (Assignment 4 in chirc). Worth 10% of your final grade.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The grade for each project is divided into the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Completeness (50 points)</p></li>
<li><p>Correctness (10 points)</p></li>
<li><p>Design (20 points)</p></li>
<li><p>Style (20 points)</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="completeness">
<h2>Completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#completeness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Completeness component of the grade will be determined by the result of running
the tests and, more specifically, on the number of points obtained when
running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">assignment-X</span></code> (see <a class="reference external" href="http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/testing.html#using-the-automated-tests">Using the automated tests</a>
in the chirc documentation).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="correctness">
<h2>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Correctness component of the grade encompasses issues with your code that, while
not explicitly captured by the tests, could lead to <em>incorrect</em> behaviour in your server.
In project 1b, we will mostly be looking at whether you are using locks
correctly. In particular, your code must adequately protect any data that can
be accessed concurrently by more than one thread. Using a Big Fat Lock (i.e.,
using a single lock for your entire server) will result in an 8 point penalty.</p>
<p>However, in general, the graders may take points off for issues like the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hardcoding reply values that happen to make the tests pass, but which would fail
under reasonable use cases (e.g., hardcoding the LUSERS values)</p></li>
<li><p>Segfaults that happen under reasonable use cases (i.e., the graders won’t be
trying to make your code fail with bizarre corner cases)</p></li>
<li><p>Not implementing something that is clearly specified in the project, even if
the tests don’t test for it (e.g., implementing a command almost completely,
but not implementing one of the replies).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that this section of the rubric will not re-penalize you for a failure
that is already captured by the tests. So, if your code fails to implement something
we told you to implement, but that is already captured by the tests, we would not
re-penalize you here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h2>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Design component of the grade will be determined by “qualities, many of which are intangible,
that don’t have to do with (and exist to some extent independently of) the correct operation of your code.”
(thanks to Adam Shaw for this concise phrasing). Across all three
parts of the project, we will be looking at least at the following
(the exact points for each of the parts of the project is specified
later):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Module/function decomposition</strong>: We will look at whether you divided your
implementation into modules and functions that make sense. This includes avoiding
repeated/redundant code, ensuring that each function performs a well-defined
task, and putting related functions in the same module (i.e., the same C file).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data structure design</strong>: We will look at whether you have designed (and/or used)
the right data structures to store your server’s state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: We will look at whether your code is minimally efficient.
In other words, we are not looking for sublimely efficient code but, rather,
for the lack of grossly inefficient code. For example, we don’t care whether
you store your list of channels in a linked list (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(n)\)</span> lookup times) or a
hash table (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(1)\)</span> lookup times), but we do care whether you iterate over a list
in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(n^2)\)</span> time when the same task can reasonably be accomplished in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(n)\)</span> time (i.e., when the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(n)\)</span> is not particularly clever or relies
on some obscure algorithm).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Project 1a, we will be looking at the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Module/function decomposition</strong> (8 points). Please note that, in this part of
the project, it is acceptable to have all your code in a single C file (so you
are not required to divide your implementation into multiple modules, but are
welcome to do so). You will get at most 5 points here if your entire implementation
is inside the main() function, without using any additional functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data structure design</strong> (8 points). We will specifically be looking at how you
handle the reassembly of partitioned messages (and the data structures to support
this).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong> (4 points)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Project 1b, we will be looking at the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Module/function decomposition</strong> (8 points). Please note that, in this part of
the project, you <em>must</em> divide your server into multiple modules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data structure design</strong> (8 points). We will specifically look at how you store
information about the server state, including the list of users (and their state)
and the list of channels (and their state).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong> (4 points)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we will discuss the module/function decomposition and
the data structure design of Project 1b on Week 2’s Tuesday lecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="style">
<h2>Style<a class="headerlink" href="#style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Style component of the grade will be determined by your adherence to
our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html">Style Guide</a>. While you should strive to follow this guide as
closely as possible, there <em>are</em> certain aspects we will be paying more
attention to. In all three parts of the project, the 20 points of the Style
portion are divided as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Documenting functions</strong> (8 points): Every function written by you must have
a <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html#function-comments">function comment</a> with a brief description
of what the function does, and a description of the parameters and the
return value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent indentation</strong> (2 points): Your code must follow one of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html#indentation">allowed indentation styles</a> consistently.
The presence of even a single tab character in your code will result in 0 points
here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong> (6 points): Your code must be easy to read and understand. This
is a fairly subjective aspect, but common deductions for lack of clarity
include using variables without descriptive names, writing convoluted code
that would be easier to understand with more code comments, using magic
numbers, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General adherence to the style guide</strong> (4 points): The graders will not be
checking that you follow every minute aspect of our style guide, and occasional
infractions are ok (and won’t necessarily be penalized). What we’re more
concerned with is that your code, overall, has a <em>consistent</em> style that
asymptotically approaches the one specified in our style guide.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the graders will apply the following penalties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html#global-variables">global variables</a>: 10 point penalty</p></li>
<li><p>Using <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html#goto-statements">goto statements</a>: 5 point penalty</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the style guide does specify a few exceptions when using
some of the above is acceptable. You will not be penalized in those cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-penalties">
<h2>Additional Penalties<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-penalties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will also apply the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reinventing wheels that don’t need to be reinvented</strong>: In this class, we expect
you to know how to use data structures like linked lists, hash tables, etc.
(and how to choose the right data structure for a given task). However, this is a Networks class,
not a Data Structures class, and you should <em>not</em> be spending any time implementing
such data structures. Instead, you should use existing data structure libraries
(our <a class="reference external" href="../academic_honesty.html">Academic Honesty</a> page lists a few publicly-available
libraries that you are welcome to use).</p>
<p>If you implement your own linked list, hash table, etc. from scratch, we will apply
a 15 point penalty. While you may think that implementing your own data structure
is a worthwhile exercise, it invariably results in more work for the TAs and graders
(as you will likely run into all sorts of issues and segfaults that could have been
avoided by using a well-known and well-tested data structures library). Plus, it will
be a much more worthwhile experience for you to understand how to incorporate an existing library
into your own code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Submitting code that doesn’t build</strong>: If the graders are able to build your
code with a few minor fixes (missing semicolons, parenthesis, etc.),
we will apply a 15 point penalty. If your code
requires substantial work to get it to build, you will receive a zero on
the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>So, make sure you verify that the version of the code you submitted builds correctly on a supported
software environment</strong> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page for more details on this)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using printf instead of chilog</strong>: All the projects in this class use a simple logging library called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> that is documented in each of the project specifications. You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions <em>exclusively</em> for printing logging or debug messages. <strong>Do not use printf() directly in your code</strong>. Please note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions provide essentially the same functionality as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>, so there is no situation where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code> would be necessary instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> consistently also means you will not have to scrub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>’s from your code before submitting it).
Using printf will result in a 5 point penalty in your code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the messages at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CRITICAL</span></code> levels must be used only for their intended purposes (e.g., only use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> to print out actual errors in the execution of your program). You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level only to print informative debug messages that would be understood by any developer trying to debug your code. You may use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level to print <em>any</em> debug message (including those that would only be understood by you). However, if your code is riddled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statements (including commented out ones) to the point where it is hard to read the code itself, we may take points off for this. So, once a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statement has served its purpose, we suggest you remove it (not just comment it out).</p>
<p>You should assume that graders will run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> level, and will only use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level if they need to debug an issue with your code. We will never run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Please note that, in assignments where you are responsible for writing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function, you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> to print to <em>standard error</em> if there is an error that prevents the program from starting (e.g., if a command-line parameter has not been provided, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Grossly incorrect memory management</strong>: Up to 5 point penalty. You should make sure
to free any memory you malloc, but we will usually not take points off unless you’ve
been grossly negligent in your malloc’ing/freeing. You should also make sure to
not “save” pointers to stack-allocated memory that is going to be deallocated.
This can happen if you store a pointer to a functions’ local variable in a struct
that is heap-allocated.</p></li>

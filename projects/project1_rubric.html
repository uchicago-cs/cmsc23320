<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This page has not yet been updated for Spring 2024. Please note that we
expect to make some fairly major changes to Project 1 in Spring 2024.</p>
</div>
<p>The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our <a class="reference external" href="../grading.html">Grading</a> page for more details.</p>
<p>You will receive two ESNU scores for this project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Completeness score</strong>: This score will be determined solely by the result of running
the automated tests, as these give a measure of how <em>complete</em> your implementation
is (i.e., how much of the assignment you implemented).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Quality score</strong>: This score is determined by a review of your code done by
the course staff, and is based on three aspects of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Correctness</em>: This encompasses issues with your code
that, while not explicitly captured by the tests, could lead to
incorrect or inefficient behaviour in your code. This can include
small mistakes in your code, as well as larger issues that reveal
a lack of mastery in the material.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Design</em>: This encompasses
“qualities, many of which are intangible, that don’t have to do with (and exist
to some extent independently of) the correct operation of your code.” (thanks to
Adam Shaw for this concise phrasing).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Style</em>: This encompasses your adherence
to our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section id="submission-timeline">
<h2>Submission Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-timeline" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This project has two required submissions, and an optional resubmission:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">

<td><p>One week after Project 1 is graded</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You will receive feedback on your Intermediate Submission before your Final Submission is due,
which means you can also treat the Final Submission as a way to improve and resubmit the work
you did in the Intermediate Submission.</p>
<p>The scores you receive on the Final Submission will be your Project 1 scores for the purposes
of computing your grade in the class. That said, once your Final Submission is graded, you will have
an opportunity to make an optional resubmission (please see the “Optional Resubmission” section
at the end of this page for more details)</p>
<p>Please note that, to earn an E in Code Quality, you must have made an initial
good-faith submission for both the Intermediate and Final submissions (i.e., work that would score at least one N or above).
So, for example, you could technically skip the Intermediate Submission entirely and only make a
Final Submission but, if you do so, your Code Quality score will be capped at an S.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you only submit chirc Assigmment 1 (with effectively no work on Assignment 4) as your Final Submission,
you will receive a U in that submission.</p>
</section>
<section id="completeness">
<h2>Completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#completeness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Completeness component will be determined by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">assignment</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">4</span>

<h2>Code Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#code-quality" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When assessing your code quality, there are a number of things we will be paying
close attention to, and which we describe in the sections below (including major
issues, labelled “[Major Issue]” that you should be particularly mindful of).</p>
<p>Please note that the items below refer to a complete Project 1
implementation (i.e., Assignments 1 and 4 of the chirc project), so some of the items
will not apply to the Intermediate Submission (most notably, you are not expected to use
threads or mutexes in that submission).</p>
<p>In general, your ESNU score will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Excellent</strong>: Your submission has none of the issues described below or, at most,
has only a few minor mistakes or small style issues that would be trivial to address.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong>: Your submission has a few of the issues described below (but no
major issues), and would only require minor changes to get to an E.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong>: Your submission has several of the issues described below,
or at least one major issue. In general, major revisions would be required to
get up to an S or E.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ungradable</strong>: Your submission does not constitute a good-faith effort to complete
the work. This includes not submitting any work at all, as well as submitting
only placeholder code (e.g., code that includes functions for all the required
IRC commands, but where the functions are empty or filled with “TODO”s, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, while the issues listed below are the main things we care about in this project,
it is not possible for us to give you an exhaustive list of every single thing that could
affect your code quality score. If you get a comment pointing out an issue in your
code that we did not list below, take it as an opportunity to improve your work
(and remember that you’ll have a chance to revise your work!)</p>
<section id="correctness">
<h3>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When assessing the correctness of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Not checking the return value of send()</strong>: send is not guaranteed to send the entire buffer you provide, which you can only tell by looking at the return value (Beej’s Guide for Socket Programming provides a <a class="reference external" href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#sendall">ready-to-use solution to this</a>, which you’re welcome to use). Of course, send could also fail, and you need to check its return value for this too.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Not checking the return value of any socket function</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not using getaddrinfo to create the server socket</strong>. Please note that some of the socket examples we provide (most notably the first server example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oneshot-single.c</span></code>) manually create the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sockaddr</span></code> struct for the sake of highlighting what that struct looks like, but that is not the usual way to create a server socket. You can see an example of how to create a server socket with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getaddrinfo</span></code> in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uchicago-cs/cmsc23320/blob/master/samples/sockets/server-pthreads.c">server-pthreads.c</a> example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not using safe string functions (strncpy vs strcpy)</strong>: Most C string functions (strcpy, strcat, etc.) have an equivalent “safe” version (strncpy, strncat, etc.) where you can specify the maximum number of characters to copy/concatenate/etc. Use these instead to protect against accidental (or malicious) buffer overflows. Alternatively, consider using a string library like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antirez/sds">sds</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treating the return of recv() as a C-string</strong>: recv() returns the raw bytes received through the network. In a protocol like IRC, this happens to be human-readable commands, but recv() won’t return a C-string (i.e., an array of characters terminated by a NULL character). It is your responsibility to add that NULL terminator if you want to manipulate the bytes returned by recv() as a C-string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardcoding reply values that happen to make some tests pass</strong>, but which would fail
under reasonable use cases. Take into account that the chirc specification does allow you to
hardcode certain replies as a stop-gap measure (e.g., hardcoding the LUSERS replies during
connection registration, so you can make progress on those tests before you properly implement
the LUSERS command). However, you must ultimately remove those
hardcoded replies with a more general implementation. Finally, for avoidance of doubt,
there are also a few spots where the specification allows you to unconditionally hardcode
certain values; those can be left hardcoded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory accesses that could lead to segfaults under reasonable use cases</strong>. The graders won’t be
trying to make your code fail with bizarre corner cases but, for example, if there is a very evident
buffer overrun in your code, that will need to be fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not implementing something that is clearly specified in the project</strong>, even if
the tests don’t test for it (e.g., implementing a command almost completely,
but not implementing one of the replies).</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Not protecting access to shared data structures (list/hash of channels, users, etc.) with a mutex</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using mutexes to protect access to data structures, but doing so inconsistently</strong> (e.g., locking the mutex only when writing to a data structure, and not when reading).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using mutexes to protect access to data structures, but not to socket accesses</strong>. See <a class="reference external" href="project1_tips.html#inadequate-locking">Inadequate locking</a> in the Project 1 tips for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Using a Big Fat Lock</strong> (i.e., using a single mutex lock for the entire server).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="design">
<h3>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When assessing the design of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>How you reassemble incoming messages</strong>: You should have some sort of array
for assembling the next message that will be processed, separate from the buffer
you pass to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recv()</span></code> function (which cannot be a 1-byte array; using a 1-byte
array when calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recv()</span></code> is considered a major issue).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How you process IRC commands</strong>: Ideally, you should use some sort of dispatch
table data structure (as described in the <a class="reference external" href="project1_tips.html">Project 1 Tips</a>)
instead of a long sequence of “if command == JOIN then…”, “if command == PRIVMSG then”,
etc. blocks of code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How you store server data</strong>. You should ideally use some sort of “server context”
structure, which we will discuss in the Project 1b lecture in Week 2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Module/function decomposition</strong>. We will look at whether you divided your implementation
into modules and functions that make sense. This includes avoiding repeated/redundant code,
ensuring that each function performs a well-defined task, and putting related functions in the
same module (i.e., the same C file). Please note that there are two potential major issues
in this regard:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Putting all your code in a single main() function</strong></p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue (in Project 1b)] <strong>Putting all your code in a single C file</strong>. Please
note that this is ok in Project 1a.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="style">
<h3>Style<a class="headerlink" href="#style" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will be checking your general adherence to
our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>
and, while we will not be checking that you follow every minute aspect of our
style guide, we do expect you to follow a <em>consistent</em> style that
asymptotically approaches the one specified in our style guide.
That said, there <em>are</em> certain aspects we will be paying more
attention to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Documenting functions</strong>: Every function written by you must have
a <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#function-comments">function comment</a> with a brief description
of what the function does, and a description of the parameters and the
return value. Please note that not documenting your functions at all
(as opposed to doing so inconsistently or not following the style guide)
is considered a major issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent indentation</strong>: Your code must follow one of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#indentation">allowed indentation styles</a> consistently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: Your code must be easy to read and understand. This
is a fairly subjective aspect, but remember that things like using
variable names without descriptive names or using magic numbers will
usually make your code harder to read.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using global variables</strong>, except when defining
compile-time constants.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using goto statements</strong>, except in the very limited cases
described in the style guide.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="other-code-quality-issues">
<h3>Other Code Quality Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#other-code-quality-issues" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a couple of other issues that we care about across all projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reinventing wheels that don’t need to be reinvented</strong>: In this class, we expect
you to know how to use data structures like linked lists, hash tables, etc.
(and how to choose the right data structure for a given task). However, this is a Networks class,
not a Data Structures class, and you should <em>not</em> be spending any time implementing
such data structures. Instead, you should use existing data structure libraries
(our <a class="reference external" href="../academic_honesty.html">Academic Honesty</a> page lists a few publicly-available
libraries that you are welcome to use).</p>
<p>Implementing your own linked list, hash table, etc. from scratch is considered
a major issue. While you may think that implementing your own data structure
is a worthwhile exercise, it invariably results in more work for the TAs and graders
(as you will likely run into all sorts of issues and segfaults that could have been
avoided by using a well-known and well-tested data structures library). Plus, it will
be a much more worthwhile experience for you to understand how to incorporate an existing library
into your own code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Submitting code that doesn’t build</strong>: If you submit code that does not build
on Gradescope’s autograder, but the graders can get it to build with some minor fixes
(missing semicolons, parenthesis, etc.),
this will just be treated as a major issue. However, if your code
requires substantial work to get it to build, you will receive a U score.</p>
<p><strong>So, make sure you verify that the version of the code you submitted builds correctly on a supported
software environment</strong> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page for more details on this)
Additionally, it is your responsibility to check that the code you submitted to Gradescope
builds correctly. If it doesn’t, but it builds correctly on your end, please let us
know so we can look into it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using printf instead of chilog</strong>: All the projects in this class use a simple logging library called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> that is documented in each of the project specifications. You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions <em>exclusively</em> for printing logging or debug messages. <strong>Do not use printf() directly in your code</strong>. Please note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions provide essentially the same functionality as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>, so there is no situation where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code> would be necessary instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> consistently also means you will not have to scrub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>’s from your code before submitting it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the messages at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CRITICAL</span></code> levels must be used only for their intended purposes (e.g., only use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> to print out actual errors in the execution of your program). You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level only to print informative debug messages that would be understood by any developer trying to debug your code. You may use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level to print <em>any</em> debug message (including those that would only be understood by you). However, if your code is riddled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statements (including commented out ones) to the point where it is hard to read the code itself, we may penalize you for this. So, once a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statement has served its purpose, we suggest you remove it (not just comment it out).</p>
<p>You should assume that graders will run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> level, and will only use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level if they need to debug an issue with your code. We will never run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Please note that, in assignments where you are responsible for writing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function, you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> to print to <em>standard error</em> if there is an error that prevents the program from starting (e.g., if a command-line parameter has not been provided, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Grossly incorrect memory management</strong>: You should make sure
to free any memory you malloc, but we will usually not penalize you unless you’ve
been grossly negligent in your malloc’ing/freeing. You should also make sure to
not “save” pointers to stack-allocated memory that is going to be deallocated.
This can happen if you store a pointer to a functions’ local variable in a struct
that is heap-allocated.</p></li>

<h2>Optional Resubmission<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-resubmission" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you receive your graded Project 1, you have two options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If you are satisfied with the scores you have received, no action is necessary on your end.
Your scores on Project 1 will be used to compute your <a class="reference external" href="../grading.html#base-grade">Base Grade</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You may make an <em>optional</em> resubmission to address any feedback you received in Project 1,
which may increase your scores in the project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: You <em>cannot</em> make a resubmission if you got E’s on both Completeness and Code Quality. If you
are in this situation and want additional feedback on your grading, please ask on Ed.</p>
<p>If you decide to make a resubmission, you <strong>MUST</strong> edit the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README</span></code> file in the root of
the repository to include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rubric items you have addressed</strong>: Rubric items that appear selected on Gradescope (under “Manual Grading”)
represent issues that had an impact on your Code Quality score. To facilitate the work of the
graders, you must list each rubric item you have addressed, with the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The rubric item description, exactly as it appears on Gradescope.</p></li>
<li><p>1-2 sentences explaining how you addressed the rubric item.</p></li>
<li><p>If the work you did on the rubric item is limited to a few lines of code, specify the filename and line number(s),
If your work on this rubric item involved deeper changes to your code, you do not need to list every single line
of code you changed, but you should try to give the graders a general sense of where you made the changes, including
a few examples if possible
(e.g., “I combed through the code to make sure I was using descriptive variable names; for example, I changed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">channel</span></code> in several functions”, “I reorganized functions <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar()</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baz()</span></code> as requested”, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rubric items you have NOT addressed</strong>: It is also important that you let us know what rubric items you
decided not to address, as this will expedite the work of the graders. For these rubric items, it is enough
to provide a list of the rubric item descriptions (exactly as they appear on Gradescope)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Substantial new code added to your submission</strong>: If you added substantial new code that was not present in your
original submission (e.g., if your original submission did not implement several commands, and you have now included
new code to implement those commands), you must specify the affected files, as well as the new functionality that
is added by the new code. For example, you could include something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">New</span> <span class="n">files</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">channel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">channel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">h</span>

</pre></div>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Changes made to pass additional tests</strong>: If you made changes to your code with the goal of passing more tests,
please specify your original test score, and the new test score. If your work only involved a few minor bug fixes,
please let us know you did this (but you do not need to specify the exact changes you made). On the other hand,
if you skipped parts of Project 1b in your original submission, and have written entirely new code, please make
sure you have specified this as part of the “substantial new code”, and that you also specify that doing so
allowed you to pass additional tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other changes</strong>: If you made other changes to your code, such as refactoring large parts of your code, make
sure to specify this too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README</span></code> file as important as the changes you are making to your code: <strong>resubmissions
that do not include the information requested above may not be graded at all</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, if you are making a resubmission that only involved addressing rubric items, without adding substantial
new code to your submission, there is a high likelihood that addressing all the rubric items will bump your Code
Quality score to at least the next score.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are making a resubmission that involves adding substantial new code, please bear in mind
that the graders could identify issues in that new code that will impact your Code Quality score. That said,
once you receive the resubmission grading, you will be given the option to revert back to your original Project 1
score if you prefer.</p>

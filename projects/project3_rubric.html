<h1>Project 3 Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#project-3-rubric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our <a class="reference external" href="../grading.html">Grading</a> page for more details.</p>
<p>You will receive two ESNU scores for this project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Completeness score</strong>: This score will be determined solely by the result of running
the automated tests, as these give a measure of how <em>complete</em> your implementation
is (i.e., how much of the assignment you implemented).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Quality score</strong>: This score is determined by a review of your code done by
the course staff, and is based on three aspects of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Correctness</em>: This encompasses issues with your code
that, while not explicitly captured by the tests, could lead to
incorrect or inefficient behaviour in your code. This can include
small mistakes in your code, as well as larger issues that reveal
a lack of mastery in the material.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Design</em>: This encompasses
“qualities, many of which are intangible, that don’t have to do with (and exist
to some extent independently of) the correct operation of your code.” (thanks to
Adam Shaw for this concise phrasing).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Style</em>: This encompasses your adherence
to our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/dev-guide/style_guide_c.html">Style Guide</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submission-timeline">
<h1>Submission Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-timeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This project has one required submission, and an optional resubmission.</p>
<p>Unlike Projects 1 and 2, the resubmission can only be used to improve your Completeness score
(i.e., the score on the automated tests). Since Project 3 is due by the end of the quarter,
there is not enough to do a full resubmission-regrading cycle.</p>
<p>The deadline for the required submission can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="../calendar.html">Course Calendar</a>.
Once you have made the required submission, you may resubmit your work up until <strong>Friday, March 18th at 5pm</strong>
to improve your score on the automated tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="completeness">
<h1>Completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#completeness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Completeness component will be determined by running the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">tests</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">grade</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(see <a class="reference external" href="http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/automated-tests.html">Automated tests</a>
in the chirouter documentation for more details)</p>
<p>Your ESNU score will then be determined as follows:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 49%" />
<col style="width: 51%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Grade</p></th>

<div class="section" id="code-quality">
<h1>Code Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#code-quality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing your code quality, there are a number of things we will be paying
close attention to, and which we describe in the sections below (including major
issues, labelled “[Major Issue]” that you should be particularly mindful of).</p>
<p>In general, your ESNU score will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Excellent</strong>: Your submission has none of the issues described below or, at most,
has only a few minor mistakes or small style issues that would be trivial to address.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong>: Your submission has a few of the issues described below (but no
major issues), and would only require minor changes to get to an E.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong>: Your submission has several of the issues described below,
or at least one major issue. In general, major revisions would be required to
get up to an S or E.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ungradable</strong>: Your submission does not constitute a good-faith effort to complete
the work. This includes not submitting any work at all, as well as submitting
only placeholder code (e.g., code that includes functions for all the required
IRC commands, but where the functions are empty or filled with “TODO”s, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, while the issues listed below are the main things we care about in this project,
it is not possible for us to give you an exhaustive list of every single thing that could
affect your code quality score. If you get a comment pointing out an issue in your
code that we did not list below, take it as an opportunity to improve your work
(and remember that you’ll have a chance to revise your work!)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="correctness">
<h1>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this project, an incorrect implementation will almost always lead to some of the tests
failing, so there are fewer things that we will be looking at when checking the correctness
of your code. Nonetheless, we will be paying special attention to the following issues
which would not be caught by the tests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Automatically sending an ARP reply for any ARP request, without checking that the requested IP address matches the router interface’s IP address</strong>. Because the destination MAC address of ARP requests is set to the broadcast address, you will receive ARP requests that may not be intended for the router. You need to check the IP address in the ARP request itself to determine whether to reply to the ARP request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sending ARP replies with a broadcast destination address</strong>. ARP replies should be sent only to the host that originally sent the ARP request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ICMP Port Unreachable: Checking for UDP or TCP payloads, but not both</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not checking the ARP cache before deciding whether to send an ARP request</strong>. If there is already a cached entry for a given IP address, there is no need to send an ARP request.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Not implementing IP forwarding at all, and instead forwarding all IP datagrams on all ports</strong></p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Hardcoding any forwarding logic, instead of using the provided routing table</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing IP forwarding, but processing the routing table incorrectly</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not locking/unlocking the ARP mutex when accessing the ARP cache or the list of pending ARP requests</strong>. Note: our code already locks the ARP mutex before calling the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chirouter_arp_process_pending_req</span></code> function, and unlocks it after it returns. No locking is necessary inside that function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managing Pending ARP Requests: Unconditionally creating new pending requests</strong>. If there is already an entry for IP address <em>X</em> in the pending ARP request list, and the router receives a new IP datagram with destination <em>X</em>, that datagram should be added to the list of withheld frames in the existing pending request. You should not create an entirely new pending request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Removing pending requests from the pending ARP request list, instead of returning ARP_REQ_REMOVE</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Removing pending requests from the pending ARP request list before the request has been sent 5 times</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not removing a pending ARP request when an ARP reply is received, or when it has been sent 5 times already</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconditionally sending a Time Exceeded reply if a forwardeable IP datagram arrives with TTL=1</strong>.  The correct approach is to first determine whether it is a Host Unreachable and, if it is not, then send a Time Exceeded (meaning that forwardeable datagrams with TTL=1 must linger in the withheld frames list so we can determine whether there is actually a host with that IP).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h1>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing the design of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Putting all your code in chirouter_process_ethernet_frame without dividing it into multiple functions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing a single massive “Process IP datagram” function, without dividing it into multiple functions.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Repeating ICMP message creation logic in multiple places in your code, instead of writing a general-purpose “create an ICMP message” function</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-code-quality-issues">
<h1>Other Code Quality Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#other-code-quality-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are a couple of other issues that we care about across all projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reinventing wheels that don’t need to be reinvented</strong>: In this class, we expect
you to know how to use data structures like linked lists, hash tables, etc.
(and how to choose the right data structure for a given task). However, this is a Networks class,
not a Data Structures class, and you should <em>not</em> be spending any time implementing
such data structures. Instead, you should use existing data structure libraries
(our <a class="reference external" href="../academic_honesty.html">Academic Honesty</a> page lists a few publicly-available
libraries that you are welcome to use).</p>
<p>Implementing your own linked list, hash table, etc. from scratch is considered
a major issue. While you may think that implementing your own data structure
is a worthwhile exercise, it invariably results in more work for the TAs and graders
(as you will likely run into all sorts of issues and segfaults that could have been
avoided by using a well-known and well-tested data structures library). Plus, it will
be a much more worthwhile experience for you to understand how to incorporate an existing library
into your own code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Submitting code that doesn’t build</strong>: If you submit code that does not build
on Gradescope’s autograder, but the graders can get it to build with some minor fixes
(missing semicolons, parenthesis, etc.),
this will just be treated as a major issue. However, if your code
requires substantial work to get it to build, you will receive a U score.</p>
<p><strong>So, make sure you verify that the version of the code you submitted builds correctly on a supported
software environment</strong> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page for more details on this)
Additionally, it is your responsibility to check that the code you submitted to Gradescope
builds correctly. If it doesn’t, but it builds correctly on your end, please let us
know so we can look into it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using printf instead of chilog</strong>: All the projects in this class use a simple logging library called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> that is documented in each of the project specifications. You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions <em>exclusively</em> for printing logging or debug messages. <strong>Do not use printf() directly in your code</strong>. Please note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions provide essentially the same functionality as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>, so there is no situation where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code> would be necessary instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> consistently also means you will not have to scrub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>’s from your code before submitting it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the messages at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CRITICAL</span></code> levels must be used only for their intended purposes (e.g., only use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> to print out actual errors in the execution of your program). You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level only to print informative debug messages that would be understood by any developer trying to debug your code. You may use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level to print <em>any</em> debug message (including those that would only be understood by you). However, if your code is riddled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statements (including commented out ones) to the point where it is hard to read the code itself, we may penalize you for this. So, once a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statement has served its purpose, we suggest you remove it (not just comment it out).</p>
<p>You should assume that graders will run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> level, and will only use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level if they need to debug an issue with your code. We will never run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Please note that, in assignments where you are responsible for writing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function, you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> to print to <em>standard error</em> if there is an error that prevents the program from starting (e.g., if a command-line parameter has not been provided, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Grossly incorrect memory management</strong>: You should make sure
to free any memory you malloc, but we will usually not penalize you unless you’ve
been grossly negligent in your malloc’ing/freeing. You should also make sure to
not “save” pointers to stack-allocated memory that is going to be deallocated.
This can happen if you store a pointer to a functions’ local variable in a struct
that is heap-allocated.</p></li>

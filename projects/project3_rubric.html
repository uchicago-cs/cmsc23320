<h1>Project 3 Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#project-3-rubric" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our <a class="reference external" href="../syllabus.html#grading">Grading</a> section of
the syllabus for more details.</p>
<p>You will receive two SNU scores for this project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Completeness score</strong>: This score will be determined solely by the result of running
the automated tests, as these give a measure of how <em>complete</em> your implementation
is (i.e., how much of the assignment you implemented).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Quality score</strong>: This score is determined by a review of your code done by
the course staff, and is based on three aspects of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Correctness</em>: This encompasses issues with your code
that, while not explicitly captured by the tests, could lead to
incorrect or inefficient behaviour in your code. This can include
small mistakes in your code, as well as larger issues that reveal
a lack of mastery in the material.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Design</em>: This encompasses
“qualities, many of which are intangible, that don’t have to do with (and exist
to some extent independently of) the correct operation of your code.” (thanks to
Adam Shaw for this concise phrasing).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Style</em>: This encompasses your adherence
to our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Documentation</em>: You will be required to submit certain documentation on
your code (the exact documentation is described below)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="submission-timeline">
<h1>Submission Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-timeline" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The exact timeline of submissions will be the following:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Submission</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Requirements</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Due Date</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Project 3</p></td>
<td><p><a class="reference external" href="http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/">chirouter</a>  (entire project)</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Thursday, December 5th, 8pm</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Resubmission (Optional)</p></td>
<td><p>You may submit a revised version to improve your Completeness score <em>only</em></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Friday, December 13th, 8pm</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Unlike Projects 1 and 2, the resubmission can only be used to improve your Completeness score
(i.e., the score on the automated tests). Since Project 3 is due by the end of the quarter,
there is not enough to do a full resubmission-regrading cycle.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: To make a resubmission, you must make a “good-faith” submission by the project
deadline. A good-faith submission is any submission where it is clear you have put in
a substantial amount of effort to complete the project. Please note that scoring an N
in Completeness is a sufficient (but not necessary) requirement for a submission to
be considered a good-faith submission.</p>
<p>This means that, if you want to make a resubmission, you cannot skip the initial
submission, or submit an effectively empty submission. The reason for this is that
such a submission could score an S in Code Quality purely because most of the rubric
items are moot (because there is little/no code to grade). Your resubmission could
then score an S in Completeness, but then have major Code Quality issues.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you are scoring an N on the tests in your initial submission, you have nothing to
worry about. You can make a resubmission to raise your test score to an S.</p></li>
<li><p>If you skip the initial submission, or score a U in the tests, we reserve the right
to regrade your code for Code Quality in the resubmission.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="completeness">
<h1>Completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#completeness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Completeness component will be determined by running the chirouter <a class="reference external" href="http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/automated-tests.html">automated tests</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In Project 3, you will be relying on manual testing to a greater extent
than in Projects 1 and 2. The automated tests provide a convenient way to run all
the tests and get a test score but, in general, if your code works when testing it
manually, and fails the corresponding automated test, you should consider the test
to have passed (you should make a note in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DOCUMENTATION.md</span></code> file so the graders are aware
of this)</p>
<p>Your SNU score will then be determined as follows:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Grade</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Points on tests</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Satisfactory</p></td>
<td><p>at least 90</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Needs Improvement</p></td>
<td><p>at least 60</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Unsatisfactory</p></td>
<td><p>less than 60</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</section>
<section id="code-quality">
<h1>Code Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#code-quality" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing your code quality, there are a number of things we will be paying
close attention to, and which we describe in the sections below (including major
issues, labelled “[Major Issue]” that you should be particularly mindful of).</p>
<p>In general, your SNU score will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong>: Your submission has a few of the issues described below (but no
major issues).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong>: Your submission has several of the issues described below,
or at least one major issue. In general, major revisions are typically required to
get up to an S.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unsatisfactory</strong>: Your submission does not constitute a good-faith effort to complete
the work. This includes not submitting any work at all, as well as submitting
only placeholder code (e.g., code that includes functions for all the required
IRC commands, but where the functions are empty or filled with “TODO”s, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, while the issues listed below are the main things we care about in this project,
it is not possible for us to give you an exhaustive list of every single thing that could
affect your code quality score. If you get a comment pointing out an issue in your
code that we did not list below, take it as an opportunity to improve your work
(and remember that you’ll have a chance to revise your work!)</p>
</section>
<section id="correctness">
<h1>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this project, an incorrect implementation will almost always lead to some of the tests
failing, so there are fewer things that we will be looking at when checking the correctness
of your code. Nonetheless, we will be paying special attention to the following issues
which would not be caught by the tests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Automatically sending an ARP reply for any ARP request, without checking that the requested IP address matches the router interface’s IP address</strong>. Because the destination MAC address of ARP requests is set to the broadcast address, you will receive ARP requests that may not be intended for the router. You need to check the IP address in the ARP request itself to determine whether to reply to the ARP request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sending ARP replies with a broadcast destination address</strong>. ARP replies should be sent only to the host that originally sent the ARP request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ICMP Port Unreachable: Checking for UDP or TCP payloads, but not both</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not checking the ARP cache before deciding whether to send an ARP request</strong>. If there is already a cached entry for a given IP address, there is no need to send an ARP request.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Not implementing IP forwarding at all, and instead forwarding all IP datagrams on all ports</strong></p></li>
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Hardcoding any forwarding logic, instead of using the provided routing table</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing IP forwarding, but processing the routing table incorrectly</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not locking/unlocking the ARP mutex when accessing the ARP cache or the list of pending ARP requests</strong>. Note: our code already locks the ARP mutex before calling the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chirouter_arp_process_pending_req</span></code> function, and unlocks it after it returns. No locking is necessary inside that function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managing Pending ARP Requests: Unconditionally creating new pending requests</strong>. If there is already an entry for IP address <em>X</em> in the pending ARP request list, and the router receives a new IP datagram with destination <em>X</em>, that datagram should be added to the list of withheld frames in the existing pending request. You should not create an entirely new pending request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Removing pending requests from the pending ARP request list in</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chirouter_arp_process_pending_req</span></code> <strong>, instead of returning ARP_REQ_REMOVE</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Removing pending requests from the pending ARP request list before the request has been sent 5 times</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not removing a pending ARP request when an ARP reply is received, or when it has been sent 5 times already</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconditionally sending a Time Exceeded reply if a forwardeable IP datagram arrives with TTL=1</strong>.  The correct approach is to first determine whether it is a Host Unreachable and, if it is not, then send a Time Exceeded (meaning that forwardeable datagrams with TTL=1 must linger in the withheld frames list so we can determine whether there is actually a host with that IP).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="design">
<h1>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When assessing the design of your code, we will be paying special attention
to the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[Major issue] <strong>Putting all your code in chirouter_process_ethernet_frame without dividing it into multiple functions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing a single massive “Process IP datagram” function, without dividing it into multiple functions.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Repeating ICMP message creation logic in multiple places in your code, instead of writing a general-purpose “create an ICMP message” function</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="style">
<h1>Style<a class="headerlink" href="#style" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>We will be checking your general adherence to
our <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html">Style Guide</a>
and, while we will not be checking that you follow every minute aspect of our
style guide, we do expect you to follow a <em>consistent</em> style that
asymptotically approaches the one specified in our style guide.
That said, there <em>are</em> certain aspects we will be paying more
attention to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Documenting functions</strong>: Every function written by you must have
a <a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#function-comments">function comment</a> with a brief description
of what the function does, and a description of the parameters and the
return value. Please note that not documenting your functions at all
(as opposed to doing so inconsistently or not following the style guide)
is considered a major issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent indentation</strong>: Your code must follow one of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/style-guide/c.html#indentation">allowed indentation styles</a> consistently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: Your code must be easy to read and understand. This
is a fairly subjective aspect, but remember that things like using
variable names without descriptive names or using magic numbers will
usually make your code harder to read.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using global variables</strong>, except when defining
compile-time constants.</p></li>
<li><p>[Major Issue] <strong>Using goto statements</strong>, except in the very limited cases
described in the style guide.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your submission must include a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DOCUMENTATION.md</span></code> file in the root of your repository

<section id="other-code-quality-issues">
<h1>Other Code Quality Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#other-code-quality-issues" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are a couple of other issues that we care about across all projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reinventing wheels that don’t need to be reinvented</strong>: In this class, we expect
you to know how to use data structures like linked lists, hash tables, etc.
(and how to choose the right data structure for a given task). However, this is a Networks class,
not a Data Structures class, and you should <em>not</em> be spending any time implementing
such data structures. The projects largely use the following data structure
implementations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html">utlist</a>: A linked list library</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/">uthash</a>: A hash table for C structures</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/antirez/sds">SDS</a>: Simple Dynamic Strings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing your own linked list, hash table, etc. from scratch is considered
a major issue. While you may think that implementing your own data structure
is a worthwhile exercise, it invariably results in more work for the TAs and graders
(as you will likely run into all sorts of issues and segfaults that could have been
avoided by using a well-known and well-tested data structures library). Plus, it will
be a much more worthwhile experience for you to understand how to incorporate an existing library
into your own code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Submitting code that doesn’t build</strong>: If you submit code that does not build
on Gradescope’s autograder, but the graders can get it to build with some minor fixes
(missing semicolons, parenthesis, etc.),
this will just be treated as a major issue. However, if your code
requires substantial work to get it to build, you will receive a U score.</p>
<p><strong>So, make sure you verify that the version of the code you submitted builds correctly on a supported
software environment</strong> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../projects/started.html">Projects - Getting Started</a> page for more details on this)
Additionally, it is your responsibility to check that the code you submitted to Gradescope
builds correctly. If it doesn’t, but it builds correctly on your end, please let us
know so we can look into it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using printf instead of chilog</strong>: All the projects in this class use a simple logging library called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> that is documented in each of the project specifications. You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions <em>exclusively</em> for printing logging or debug messages. <strong>Do not use printf() directly in your code</strong>. Please note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> functions provide essentially the same functionality as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>, so there is no situation where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code> would be necessary instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chilog</span></code> consistently also means you will not have to scrub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>’s from your code before submitting it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the messages at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CRITICAL</span></code> levels must be used only for their intended purposes (e.g., only use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> to print out actual errors in the execution of your program). You must use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level only to print informative debug messages that would be understood by any developer trying to debug your code. You may use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level to print <em>any</em> debug message (including those that would only be understood by you). However, if your code is riddled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statements (including commented out ones) to the point where it is hard to read the code itself, we may penalize you for this. So, once a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> logging statement has served its purpose, we suggest you remove it (not just comment it out).</p>
<p>You should assume that graders will run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> level, and will only use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> level if they need to debug an issue with your code. We will never run your code with logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRACE</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Please note that, in assignments where you are responsible for writing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> function, you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> to print to <em>standard error</em> if there is an error that prevents the program from starting (e.g., if a command-line parameter has not been provided, etc.)</p>

<li><p><strong>Grossly incorrect memory management</strong>: You should make sure
to free any memory you malloc, but we will usually not penalize you unless you’ve
been grossly negligent in your malloc’ing/freeing. You should also make sure to
not “save” pointers to stack-allocated memory that is going to be deallocated.
This can happen if you store a pointer to a functions’ local variable in a struct
that is heap-allocated.</p></li>
